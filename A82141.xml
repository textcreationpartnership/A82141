         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>VVEE your Souldiers who have ſerved under your commands with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to free this our Native Land and Nation from all Tyrannie and Opreſſions whatſoever, and that by vertue and power derived from this preſent Parliament, given not only to his Excellencie Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> our now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Generall but likewiſe under all the late Generalls his predeceſſors, under whom wee, even the whole Souldery, have ſerved both the State and you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently: By which meanes God hath been pleaſed to crowne us with Victorie, in diſperſing our common adverſaries, ſo that we hoped to put an end to all Tyranny and Oppreſſions, ſo that Juſtice and Equitie, according to the Law of this Land, ſhould have been done to the People, and that the meaneſt ſubject ſhould fully enjoy his Right, Libertie, and proprieties in all things: which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hath made known to all the world in divers of their Declarations, to which they have ſo often bound themſelves to performe, by their Oahes, Vowes, Covenants, and Proteſtations. Upon this ground of hope, we have gone through all difficulties and dangers, that we might purchaſe to the people of this Land, with our ſelves, a plentifull crop and harveſt of Libertie and Peace, but inſtead of it, to the great greif and ſadding of our hearts, wee ſee that oppreſſion is as great as ever, if not greater, yea, and that upon the cordiall freinds to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and us, and to the juſt Rights and Liberties of this Nation, that they with us are ſlighted, abuſed, beaten, and dragged to Jayles; yea, to the utter ruine of their eſtates, and loſſe of their lives, yea the beſt and moſt candid intentions, and actions of theirs and ours groſſely and foulely miſ-conſtrued, even to ſuch a height as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving no leſſe then to be declared as troublers of, and enemies to the State and

               <p>Therefore, brave Commanders, the Lord put a ſpirit of courage into your hearts, that you may ſtand faſt in your integrity, that you have manifeſted to us your Souldiers; and we do declare to you, that if any of you ſhall not, he ſhall be marked with a brand of infamy for ever, as a Traytor to his Country, and an Enemy to his Army. Read, and conſider; was there ever ſuch things done by a Parliament, to proclaime us <hi>Enemies to the State,</hi> as they have done about the late Petition? the Lords and they could quickly agree to this, though they will be very tedious when any thing is offered that is for the good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and to keep the hirelings<note n="*" place="margin">As that of 26. moneths, the Horſe are behind 13, Moneths pay, and now to have but two Moneths pay: judge Heaven, and free people; God be judge of this great evill.</note> Wages, and not to give them that which they have ſo dearely bought with their blouds and lives, even his pay; and not only ſo, but to leave them to the mercileſſe malice of their wicked Enemies.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Opinion and humble Adviſe of the Councell of Warre, convened at <hi>Bury,</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday <hi>29. May. 1647.</hi> In relation to the votes of Parliament, communicated to us by your Excellency, and the deſires of our advice thercon,</head>
               <opener>Humbly Sheweth,</opener>
               <p n="1">1. THat upon the reports come to all quarters of the Army concerning the Votes and proceedings of the Houſe, May 21. As alſo of thoſe on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, May 25. we find the generallity of the Army [as we are our ſelves] much unſatisfied in the one, and ſomething amazed and ſtartled at the other, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116153:8"/>firſt Votes (of Friday) coming much ſhort of ſatisfaction as to the greivances of the Army, then reported to the Houſe, and not taking any notice at all of ſome that were moſt materiall, and the latter (of Tueſday) importing a reſolution ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to disband the Army by peace-meale, before equall ſatisfaction be given to the whole in any of the greivances, or ſo much as any conſideration had of ſome others moſt materiall; And alſo before any effectuall performance of that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which the Votes of Friday ſeemed to promiſe, as to ſome of the grievances, all which we ſhall be readie (upon a little time given us) to repreſent to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, more diſtinctly and in particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſaid diſtraction, and the jealouſies occaſioned upon the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as we feare, and by ſome effects already appearing, do find, may unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily produce dangerous diſturbances and tumultuous actions amongſt ſeverall parts of the Army, as they now lie diſperſed and remote from the Head-quarters, eſpecially amongſt thoſe Regiments whoſe principall Officers, by neglecting or diſerting their Soldiers in their neceſſary concernments, or juſt grievances, have diſobliged their Souldiers, and loſt their intereſt with them, in ſo much as ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are in ſome ſort forced to with draw from their charges and can ſcarce with ſafety come at them, and to prevent the inconveniences or ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ſuch diſturbed or tumultuous actings might produce, either to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes where the Army quarters or to the Kingdome, We humbly adviſe your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency without delay, to draw the Army (or at leaſt thoſe parts thereof that are not fixt to certain Quarters, upon particular duty) unto a cloſer poſture of Quarters, ſo as each Regiment, Troop, and Company, may lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the veiw, and over ſight of their reſpective Officers that are left with them, and all of them under a nearer view of, and correſpondency with the Head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which may thus have a readier influence upon all, for the better preſerving of good Order, and prevention of inconveniences, and in ſuch poſture for the Countryes eaſe, to remove and ſhift the whole Quarter once a week at leaſt, till upon further ſatisfaction, the Army may be quietly and orderly diſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That upon the ſame diſſatisfaction and jealouſies we find an extream earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and violent propenſity among the ſouldiers to a generall Rendezvouz, and we verily beleive, that the firſt attempt to disband any one Regiment,before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall ſatisfaction to all, and aſſurance againſt thoſe things they have cauſe to fear, will occaſion them all to draw together and Rendezvouz of themſelves, as it were upon an Alarm. And to prevent the inconveniences or ill conſequences both to theſe Countries and the Kingdome, of any ſuch tumultuous or confuſed drawing to a Rendezvouz without order, we humbly adviſe your Excellency without delay after the contracting of quarters, to order a generall Rendezvouz for thoſe parts of the Army, whoſe quarters ſhall be ſo contracted: And this we adviſe and deſire the rather becauſe of the ſcandalous ſuggeſtions of ſome, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116153:9"/>importing as if the late diſcontents appearing in the Army, and the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of grievances from the Army, were not really in or from the body of the Souldiery, but a meere deluſion or appearance made by the contrivance and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſome factious Officers, or other Perſons in the Army. the truth and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood whereof, as alſo the true temper and diſpoſition of the Army, your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and all other, may moſt clearly diſcover by ſuch a Generall Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, without the delay or troubl of going to every Regiment a part as they now lye) the Army may more certainly underſtand what they may expect from the Parliament, and both Parliament and Kingdome what to judge and truſt to, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Army, and to that purpoſe at ſuch a Rendezvouz, we ſhall (we hope through the grace of God) diſcharge our duties to the Parliament and Kingdom, as well as to your Excellency and the Army, and demonſtrate that the good and quiet of the Kingdome, is much dearer to us then any particular concernment of our own. Theſe two laſt things we humbly adviſe and deſire may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, or that otherwiſe we may be held acquitted from all inconveniences that may enſue in our ſeverall charges.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Since (beſides the diſſatisfaction to the Army hitherto, in the points of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and the defect of aſſurance, as to ſeveral of theſe things promiſed for our ſatisfaction, and beſides the jealouſies occaſioned upon the Votes of Tueſday laſt, and all the ill conſequences which may follow in proceeding thereupon) That courſe of disbanding the Army by peece-meale before the ſatisfaction intended, be performed equally to the whole, ſeemes ſomething ſtrange and unuſuall (not practiſed in disbanding of other Armies, as Major Gen. <hi>Maſſies</hi> Brigade, the <hi>Scots Army,</hi> &amp;c or uſed that we have heard of, by any States towards any Army that was ever accounted faithfull; We humbly deſire your Excellency by an effectual Letter to move the Parliament for this, as that which we humbly offer and do beg at them, both for their owne honor, in relation to what future Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they may have occaſion to imploy, for the reputation of your Excellency, and this Army, as well as for its better ſatisfaction, and as they tender the good and aſſured quiet of this Kingdome, or the effectuall reliefe and ſaving of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they would be pleaſed to reſume the conſideration of things voted on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, and to ſuſpend any preſent proceeding thereupon, as alſo to reſume the grievances of the Army, together with the things propoſed in the concluſion of the Narrative from the Officers, and to give ſatisfaction, or at leaſt ſome reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to each of them, and that they would not think it fit to put that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, thoſe jealouſies, and that diſhonour upon the Army, as to take it disbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſcattered peieces, before ſatisfaction be equally given to the whole.</p>
               <p>Whereas, what we here deſire your Excellency to move, may be ſaid, if admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into conſideration, to tend to delay the reliefe of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We find moſt clearly, that the great hopes ſuggeſted to the Parliament, of the ſupply of that ſvrvice in that way at preſent intended, will prove as to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116153:9"/>expectation out of this Army, but vaine and deluſive, as the loud noyſe of ſo many powerfull Officers, with 50. Companies of Foot, and ten of Horſe, ſo long ſince ingaged for that ſervice, have already proved, and if herein our judgment be not credited, we have yet diſcharged our duty to the Parliament, and both Kingdomes in declaring it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We cannot but for our owne, and the Armies further diſcharge, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, declare, That if the Parliament had not been abuſed by many of thoſe they have employed, and intruſted for the promotion of that ſervice, and had not bin by ſuch mens falſe informations, or miſrepreſentations concerning the Army, or otherwiſe diverted from the conſideration of, or from giving reaſonable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Army in theſe things propoſed by the generality of the Officers at the firſt meeting at <hi>Walden</hi> in March laſt in order to that ſervice, and had not by like miſchievous practiſes of ſuch incendiaries been ſince then moved and drawn to ſuch things, and in ſuch a ſeries and ſucceſſion, as have conduced to multiply diſcontents, diſobligations, and provocations upon the Army, (we ſay had it not been for ſuch perſons and ſuch things) we are confident might have had [if they had pleaſed] an Army entire, and ready formed under their old Officers, and conduct, to have engaged for that ſervice, having found a juſt conſideration for the ſervices paſt and aſſurance of pay and ſubſiſtence in that to come.</p>

               <p>HAving received at the laſt convention of the Officers of the Army (at <hi>Walden</hi>) your commands and directions to our Regiaments; Firſt, for publiſhing the Votes of the Houſe of Commons for the ſatisfaction of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in point of Arreares and Indemnity. And ſecondly, for a faithfull, diligent, and impartiall enquiry into the preſent temper and diſpoſition of the Army: In which, having accordingly (with diligence) endevoured to anſwer your expectation in what you have enjoyned us; we doe, to the beſt of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, repreſent unto you, That we finde both Officers and Souldiers at preſent, quiet, and free from any viſible diſtemper: Nevertheleſſe are ſenſible of many preſſing grievances, which they having orderly and quietly made known unto us, we humbly in their, and our behalves, repreſent unto you as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That whereas it pleaſed the honourable Houſes of Parliament, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived information of a dangerous petition in the Army, to declare and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly publiſh in print to the Kingdome, That that Petition (which indeed was but onely intended to be preſented to the Generall with ſubmiſſion to his approbation) did tend to put the Army into diſtemper and mutiny to obſtruct the reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and put conditions upon the Parliament, and declaring the Petitioners, if they ſhall continue in their diſtempered condition, and goe on in promoting and advancing that Petition, and, ſhall be lookt upon, and proceeded againſt as enemies to the State, and diſturbers of the publick peace. Which ſaid information miſrepreſenting our intentions, hath cauſed that heavy charge which remains upon record, as a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of infamy upon us to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, we cannot chuſe but with ſadneſſe of ſpirit, be deeply ſenſible, that ſo humble and innocent an addreſſe intended to the Generall, could beget ſo ſtrange an interpretation, the ſubſtance of thoſe things which we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſue for therein, being no other then what the Parliament promiſed, and frequently confirmed unto by their Declarations.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That whereas thoſe perſons, who have by the foreſaid Information, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to our great prejudice, to beget miſ-underſtandings betwixt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and their Army, by their ſurreptitious obtaining and miſrepreſenting our intention in the ſaid Petition, and by divulging abroad ſcandalous Letters from unknowne hands, (the Authours whereof are concealed, and not brought forth to make judiciall proofes of thoſe things laid to our charge, which wee cannot but look upon as a juſt cauſe of grief, that the ſuggeſters of ſuch things ſeemed to prevaile ſo farre as to gaine encouragement, and we who are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, remaine unjuſtified in the eyes of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That divers Officers of the Army of publick and knowne integrity, have been ſent for to the Parliament, ſome whereof at this preſent attended there,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116153:11"/>and have had no tryall, nor any thing conſiderable, that we know of, layd to their charge. And more particularly, That Enſigne <hi>Nichols,</hi> a member of this Army, hath been illegally impriſoned by Capt. <hi>Dormer,</hi> a late Officer of this Army, (but now engaged for <hi>Ireland</hi>) his Pockets ſearch't, and his Papers taken from him contrary to the Lawes of the Kingdome, or Diſcipline of war, and ſince (by order of the Commiſſioners) ſent from <hi>Derby-Houſe</hi> to treat with the Army about the reliefe of <hi>Ireland;</hi> was ſent to <hi>London,</hi> (without the Generals privity,) where he is ſtill kept Priſoner) at great expences, and not brought to tryall; which preſident may equally extend to any or all in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Which ſaid particular, bearing with it the face of delay and protraction, we cannot but looke upon as a juſt cauſe of trouble unto us.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That whereas we underſtand, that the Parliament hath voted aſudden disbanding of the ARMY, not having made a ſufficient proviſion for the auditing of our Arrears, and ſtating of our accounts ſo fully, as we may not be liable to future charges concerning them, our owne reaſon, and the experience of others, doth make us ſenſible, how difficult, chargeable, and uncerrain the oftaining thereof will be after we are disbanded, and diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our ſeverall homes.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That no proviſion hath been made for the payment of our dearly earned wages, to the expence of our blood, and often hazard of our lives; ſaving a Vote of ſix weeks pay upon disbanding: Now at the conſummation of our work) which is ſo ſmall, that it will inevitably expoſe us (eſpecially the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldiers) to great extremity, being ſearſe ſufficient to maintain many of them in their journey to their own homes.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That nothing as yet hath been perfected for our future ſecurity for things done as Souldiers in relation to the warre, which the exigency thereof, and difficulties therein, hath compelled, us unto the want whereof we cannot chuſe but be very ſenſible of, when we conſider the many ſad examples of bitter and rigorous proſecutions at Law, againſt Souldiers for acts done in order to the promotion of the Kingdomes ſervice.</p>
               <p n="7">7 That we ſtand in feare, (eſpecially the private Souldiers) of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed or inforced to ſerve as Souldiers out of the Kingdome; many having ſpent themſelves freely and voluntarily in the publicke ſervice, forſaking their trades, and friends, and livelihoods; to which many deſire to returne again for their better future ſubſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="8">8 That whereas divers of us (eſpecially the private Souldiers) who were Apprentices in <hi>London,</hi> or other parts of the Kingdome, have voluntarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves in this ſervice, being incouraged thereunto by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Declarations, ſhewing that the time they ſhould ſo ſpend in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution thereof, ſhould be as effectuall in order to their Freedome, as if they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116153:11"/>had remainened with their ſeverall reſpective Maſters. Notwithſtanding which, many have refuſed to give us freedome, who may juſtly claim it by the aforeſaid Declarations for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9 That many Souldiers who have l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BY my laſt of Friday the 4 inſtant, I gave you account of what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from Holmby concerning the undertaking of ſome Souldiers on Wedneſday laſt, to ſecure the King from being ſecretly conveyed away, and that Col. <hi>Graves</hi> being thereupon ſecretly ſlipt away, I had ſent Col. <hi>Whaley</hi> with his Regiment to attend the Commiſſioners, and take charge of the Guards there, On Saturday morning, being at a Randezvouze, beyond New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market, and advancing the Army this way, in order to quarter about Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, I received advertiſement, That the Souldiers of Holmby had upon Friday morning (with his Majeſties conſent) brought him away from thence, together with your Commiſſioners, That they lay at Hinchingbrook near Huntingdon on Friday night, and would be at Newmarket that day; The ground of this remove was alledged to be an apprehenſion in the Souldiers of ſome Forces gathering towards that place ſuddenly to fal upon them, &amp; for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116153:13"/>upon this immediately I ſent after Col.

               <p>And to prevent any danger imaginable therein, I ſent off from the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz two Regiments of Horſe more, to march after Col. <hi>Whaley</hi> towards Huntingdon, and ſo on towards Holdenby, to be aſſiſtant to him in the Guards about his Majeſty, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the Quarters of the Army were aſſigned. and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up hereabouts, and the Regiments marching off towards their ſeverall Quarters, I underſtood from Collonel Whaley, that meeting the King and your Commiſſioners, upon their way from Huntington towards New-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, about foure miles ſhort of Cambridge, they had forborn to come on any further; but his Majeſty being not willing to return back for Holdenby, they had taken up his Quarter for preſent at Sir <hi>John Cuts</hi> his houſe at <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derley,</hi> being the next houſe of any conveniency to the place where we met them.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I ſent thither Sir <hi>Hardres Waller,</hi> and. Col. <hi>Lambert,</hi> to informe the Commiſſioners of my comming to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Armies quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereabouts, and to deſire, that they would think of returning back with his Majeſty to Holdenby, and (becauſe there might bee many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies in delay) that they would not make any ſtay where they were, but remove back that way next morning (though it were the Lords day) the Commiſſioners refuſed to act or meddle any otherwiſe in diſpoſing the King, then by their Anſwer to me, (whereof I have ſent you a Copy here incloſed) you ſee. And his Majeſty declares himſelfe very unwilling to goe back to Holdenby. I have thus given you a true and faithfull account, how his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty came to the place where he is, and how the Quarters of the Army have fallen out to be ſo neare him.</p>
               <p>What ever (by the concurrence of events to make it thus) may be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of deſigne therein. This is the exact truth of the buſineſſe, and I can clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe, (as in the preſence of God) for my ſelf, and dare be confident of the ſame for all the Officers about me, and body of the Army, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move of his Majeſty from Holde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the effect is ſo farre meerly providentiall, and (to us) accidentall; but the caſe being
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116153:13"/>as it is (your Commiſſioners refuſing to intermeddle as before, and the King to goe back) I have placed and ſhall continue about his Majeſty, ſuch a Guard of truſty men, and under ſuch command, (Collonell Whaley being chiefe in the charge) as I may be reſponſall for to the Parliament and Kingdome, (ſo farre as can reaſonably be expected from me) by the bleſſing of God to ſecure his Majeſties perſon from danger, and prevent any attempts of ſuch as may deſigne, (by that advantage of his Perſon) the beſt to raiſe any new Warre in this Kingdome. And truely (Sir,) to prevent any ſuch miſchiefe as it is my own moſt earneſt and humble deſire, ſo I finde it to be the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous deſire and ſtudy of the Army, that a firme peace in this Kingdome may be ſetled, and the Liberties of the people cleared and ſecured according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the many Declarations by which we were invited and induced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the late War: and the Parliaments effectuall and ſpeedy application to theſe two things (I finde) would conduce more fully and ſurely to a chearefull and unanimous disbanding; And yet (what ever may be ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or ſuſpected). I doe certainly finde (and dare aſſure you; you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it.) That the ſenſe of the Army is moſt cleare from any purpoſe, or inclination, to oppoſe the ſetling of Presbytery, or to have the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Government ſet up, or to uphold a licentiouſneſſe in Religion, or to meddle with any ſuch thing, to the advancement of any particular party or intereſt whatſoever, but to leave all ſuch particular matters to the wiſdome of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>I ſhall by the next ſend you a full Account of the proceeding and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reſolutions of the Army at the late Rendezvouze (being not at preſent prepared ſo fully as is fit.) The letter from both Houſes I have received but this night, the Quarters of the Army being lately altered before, will make the Heath neere New market leſſe convenient for a Randezvouze, yet I ſhall take order (according to the deſire of the Houſes) to have a Randezvouze ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there or not farre of on Wedneſday next, I remain.</p>

               <p>Underſtanding, that his Majeſty and your Commiſſioners were much ſtraitened and diſaccommodated in the Houſe of <hi>Childerley,</hi> I went thither yeſterday to adviſe with your Commiſſioners about the diſpoſall of his Majeſty, for more conveniency to himſelfe and them, then that place did afford: The Commiſſioners were pleaſed wholly to refuſe giving of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe or opinion at all in the buſineſſe, and therefore the King declaring his Reſolution not to goe back to <hi>Holdenby,</hi> unleſſe he were forced, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining much of the inconveniency he ſuffered where he was, and preſſing for a remove to <hi>New-Market,</hi> and your Commiſſioners not judging it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for him to be there: I ordered Col. <hi>Whalley</hi> this day to attend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the Commiſſioners thither, with a truſty and ſufficient Guard of two Regiaments of Horſe, which accordingly was this day done, and his Majeſty, with the Commiſſioners, gone to <hi>New Market</hi> but not through <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi> This buſineſſe taking up the whole time yeſterday, and it being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary his Majeſty ſhould be diſpoſed of: before the place of Rendezvouze could well bee reſolved on, this morning at a Councell of Warre, it was judged inconvenient, and ſcarce poſſible to draw to a Rendezvouze to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row early enough to diſpatch any thing; Therefore it is appointed on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning at nine of the Clocke: and in regard of his Majeſties going to <hi>New-Market,</hi> it was thought fit by the Councell of Warre, that the place of Rendezvouze might bee altered from <hi>New-Market</hi>-Heath to <hi>Triploe</hi>-Heath, five miles from this Towne: I ſhall take care that your Commiſsioners if they come to <hi>New-Market,</hi> may have notice of this alteration from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer appointment, I remaine</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas upon the Report made to the Houſe of Commons on Friday <hi>May</hi> 21. concerning the grievances of the Army, that Houſe was pleaſed to paſſe ſeverall Votes ſeeming to tend towards the ſatisfaction of the Army in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: and on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following (<hi>May</hi> 25.) to paſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Reſolutions upon a Report from the Committee at <hi>Derby-Houſe</hi> concerning the disbanding of the Foot of this Army each Regiment apart at ſeverall times and places: We humbly declare, that the ſaid Votes of <hi>Friday</hi> do come farre ſhort of ſatisfaction, (as to the ſaid grievances) or to the deſires propoſed by the Officers in the concluſion of their <hi>Narrative.</hi> And that the latter Votes of <hi>Tueſday</hi> importing a reſolution to disband the Army in part, before equall ſatisfaction be given to the whole in the greivances, or ſo much as any conſideration had of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are moſt materiall, and alſo before any effectuall performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that ſatisfaction with the Votes of <hi>Friday</hi> ſeemed to promiſe as to ſome of the Greivances, we cannot but be much unſatisfyed and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at it, as in the particulars following it may appeare we have cauſe.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:116153:17"/>
            <p n="1">1. The proportion of but Eight weeks Arrears to be paid at disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as it is unreaſonably ſhort of what is moſt due, and what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive may be paid, or might eaſily have been provided ſince the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſo long had the whole Kingdome cleared, all trading and commerce opened, vaſt ſummes of money brought in upon Delinquents, Compoſitions and otherwiſe, and great foundations of ſecurity in their hands, (beſides thoſe formerly ingaged for the <hi>Scots</hi>) And as it is but a mean reward for all our labours, hardſhips and hazards in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms cauſe, and a very ſlender ſupply to carry us to our homes, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſutable to the Parliaments honour and our ſucceſſe, and much leſſe to enable thoſe that have left good trades or other wayes of livelihood, and ſuffered much in their trades or ſtocks, by ſo doing, to ſet up again in their former callings and conditions; ſo it is but little (if any thing) more then what hath been due to us ſince that time that we firſt went about to have petitioned for our Arrears, and ſo not to be accounted in ſatisfaction towards former Arrears, which the Petition was meant for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Orders given for the ſtating of our Accounts, giving Deber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for our Arrears by the Committee of the Army, we find no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or regard had of our Arrears incurred in former Army or ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which to the moſt of us are much greater then thoſe under the <hi>New-Model,</hi> intended to be ſtated by the Committee for the Army, (as the <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Officers,) printed by miſtake under the name of their Declaration, did intimate before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We cannot but conſider, that (whatever the Officers, expectances upon Debentures may prove) the private Souldiers may well make little account of whatever part of his Arrears he receives not before disbanding, as the Reaſons expreſſe in the <hi>Narrative</hi> do ſhew. And whereas we hear of ſome inſtruction paſt man Ordinance for ſtating of Arrears, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they direct 3. <abbr>s.</abbr> a week to be abated to Foot-Souldiers for Quarter, which being 6 <abbr>
                  <hi rend="sup">•</hi>
               </abbr>. or 8 <abbr>
                  <hi rend="sup">d</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>per diem</hi> above the rate they ſhould have paid for themſelves, if they had timely had Pay wherewithall; It ſeems very hard the poore Souldier ſhould allow intereſt for the forbearance of his own due.</p>
            <p>The like diſproportion we find in the abatements to Serjeants of Foot for their Quarters: in the abatement for Quarters to Officers of Horſe and Dragoons, we find one third part of the whole Pay to them due both for themſelves and their Horſes is to be defalked, though the full pay for their Horſes is not allowed in the Account, unleſſe they make it appeare by Muſters that they kept their full numbers; and the third part of their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116153:17"/>full pay, amounting to the halfe or near the halfe of their preſent pay, ſeems an unreaſonable allowance for Quarters, eſpecially in the caſe of Captains and Field-Officers. We find alſo no proviſion made for private Souldiers of Horſe, or Foot, or any Officers in Commiſſion or not in Commiſſion, in relation to any Quarters diſcharged by them, but all ſuch are left abſolutely to abate the reſpective Rates for Quarters during their whole time whether they have paid Quarters for any part of the time or no, whereas we know aſſuredly and can make appeare, that all of them during their ſervice in this Army, (and moſt of them in their ſervice in the former Armyes) have really diſcharged their Quarters for a very great part of the time, and many of them for more time then by the proportion of pay received, they were bound to have done; having without reſpects to that many times paid freely, as farre as their money would hold out, partly out of deſire not to be burthenſome at all to the Countrey as farre as they could, and partly upon expectation (groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the many promiſes and often renewed, of conſtant pay for time to come) that mony would come in time to pay them up, and reimburſe them their full pay againe without defalcation for Quarters; we find is alſo provided, that no Trooper is capable of allowance or debenture for Arrears unleſſe he deliver in ſuch Horſe and Armes, with which he hath ſerved or a Certificate, what ſuch Horſe and Armes did not appertaine to the State, or elſe was loſt in actuall ſervice which extends to the totall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away from them thoſe Horſe and Armes of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ates, which they have uſed and preſerved in the Service, contrary to the favour allowed; and never (that we knew of) denied in the disbanding of any other Army: and if that being but a matter of favour, the horſe-men in this ſervice be thought unworthy of it, and muſt upon account for their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, rebate for ſuch Horſe and Armes as upon disbanding they thought to have been given them, yet it ſeems hard that ſuch as cannot delives in thoſe States Horſe and Armes, which at disbanding they ſo underſtood to be their owne, and ſo perhaps have ſold or otherwiſe diſpoſed of, ſhould for that loſe their whole Arrears, or be incapable of account or debenture for any part thereof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The viſible ſecurity for what Arrears ſhould not be paid at disbanding (which the Votes of Friday, May 21. ſeeme to promiſe) as in ſtands propounded in the Votes of Tueſday May 25. appeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not to be either a ſecuritie ſufficient or to us viſible.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe that ſecurity of the Excize in Courſe (propoſed for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears of private Souldiers and inferior Officers, is knowne to be already pre-ingaged for vaſt ſummes amounting to above a Million that are to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116153:18"/>take place before thoſe Arrears, not do we know certainly that the Excize (which is yet but temporarie) will be continued for ſo long time as till our Arrears ſhall come out in courſe after the preceding ingagements ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe that ſecurity propoſed for Officers Arrears, <hi>viz.</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ariſing out of Delinquents eſtates in the firſt Exception, (eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limited to ſuch as are not already diſpoſed of, it does not appear what they will amount unto, or what the pre-ingagements or pre-diſpoſures by the Parliament may be, or what incumbrances of Debts, or limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eſtates (as they were in the hands of the Owners) may lie upon the ſame, none of which we would be any occaſion to defeat or avoid, ſo as to have the curſes and grudges of defrauded Creditors or ruined Families to lie upon us or our Poſterities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither the one ſecurity nor the other are yet, for ought we find, or could well before the appointed times of disbanding, be ſo ſetled by Ordinance to the uſes propoſed (as the other Securities for monies bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed by the Parliament have been) which we conceive requiſite to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame indeed viſible ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe Reaſons we ſhould not urge ſo much, if we did not ſee other matters of Security within the Kingdome that would be much more cleare, (as Cathedrals and their Revenues, Forreſt-Lands &amp;c.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Ordinance voted to exempt from preſſing (1.) is not, for ought we derſtand, brought in and paſſed before the appointed Disbanding. Next, by the Vote it ſeems not to intend the exempting of voluntier Horſe men from being preſt for Foot-ſervice. And laſtly, we underſtand not how it can be effectuall to particular Souldiers (when diſperſt about the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſojourning or travelling where perhaps their former relation to this Army, or condition as Voluntiers in it may not be known, or not credited upon their words) unleſſe the Ordinance intended ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, that a teſtimoniall of their ſervice under the General's or their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Field-Officers or Captains hands (which they might ever carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or keep by them,) ſhall be their ſufficient diſcharge from any Preſſe (if they ſhall fall under it.) And whereas ſuch Teſtimonials can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be got by them after Disbanding; The ſaid Votes for ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Disbanding, and at ſuch diſtances, do not mention or admit any thing of that kinde more then Paſſes from the Commiſſioners to carry them whom.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Ordinance voted to give Apprentices the benefit of their time ſpent in the Parliaments ſervice, as alſo that for the maintenance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116153:18"/>of maimed Souldiers, and the Widowes and children of men ſlaine in the ſervice, were not brought in and paſſed before the appointed Disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, nor do we yet hear, that they yet are, though we hope they will be.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Ordinance paſſed for Indempnity ſeems to make but ſlender proviſion for our quiet, eaſe, or ſafety in relation to things done in the War as Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the things it provides for throughout the Ordinance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed only in theſe termes <hi>(viz.) things done by vertue of any Ordinance of Parliament or for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament;</hi> We conceive, that upon every treſpaſſe, or other thing done in the War (which we may be queſtioned for) it will be very chargeable and difficult, either to derive a clear Authority for the ſame from Ordinance of Parliament, or to bring proofs ſufficient to make up ſuch a conſtructive concluſion, as that it was for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament, eſpecially to do this ſo fully, as to meet with all the evaſions and eluſions of a ſubtle Lawyer, or to convince the ſences of a Countrey Jury, whom we know not by what rules or meaſure they may go in judging what was for the ſervice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Parliament, or what not; perhaps ſome of them may be of that mind, that it had been for the ſervice and benefit of the Parliament, to have had no War at all, or to have had fewer or no ſuch Garriſons or Forces as ſome of us have been engaged in. In ſome, We cannot thinke it ſafe to bee left to the ſenſe or conſtruction of a Countrey Jury, concerning the exigencies of War, or duty of a Souldier upon ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an Iſſue; We ſhould rather thinke, that the old Iſſue, which (as we underſtand) ancient Laws have provided for in ſuch caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> (Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing were done <hi>tempore &amp; loco belli</hi>) was much-more cleare and ſure; and an act or Ordinance of Oblivion for all treſpaſſes or other things ſo done by Souldiers in this War, would be moſt ſafe and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the proviſion in the ſald Ordinance now paſt for Reliefe, by Complaint to a Committee of Parliament at <hi>London</hi> (which ſeems to be meant for ſaving of charges to poor men) we doubt will prove a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote helpe, and far more chargeable for a poor Souldier Impriſoned or Arreſted in the Countrey, then the former: And though we highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor that Committee named in the Ordinance (for the major part of it) yet we confeſſe we ſhall be ſorry that our reliefe (if it may otherwiſe be provided for) ſhould be the occaſion of ſetting up more arbitrary Courts, then there are already, with ſo large a power of impriſoning any Free-men of <hi>England,</hi> as the Ordinance gives to that Committee, let the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116153:19"/>intruſted appeare at preſent never ſo juſt and faithfull, or though all that Committee were as good Patriots, as we hold the major part to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the matter of Accompts, we are wholly left (as before) to the mercy of the Committee for Accompts, and their ſul-Committees, whoſe conſtitution (in moſt Counties,) being at leaſt of Neuters (diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the War, and conſequently to the Souldiery) and whoſe vaſt and Arbitrary power to vex, delay, fine and impriſon at their owne Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or judgement, any that they can bring within the compaſſe of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptants, and to proceed upon their own judgement of the default, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter, ſell and diſpoſe of his Eſtate, as upon a Commiſſion of Bankrupt, (we confeſſe) we tremble to thinke of more then of any Enemy.

            <p>Eigthly, Though thoſe Officers of the Army at ſeverall times ſent for, or ſend up to attend the Parliament as Delinquents, have been indeed, diſcharged (for which we render our thanks, and acknowledge the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Juſtice in the diſcharge) yet for men of ſuch credit and integrity to have their names brought ſo highly into publick queſtion or ſuſpition, and the cauſe not known, (which might make it imagined greater) to be kept long in attendance under that notion, and not obtaine by their daily ſolicitations to know their Accuſers or any Charge, and (for one of them) to be made a Priſoner, ſearched and ſent up ſo farre in a diſgraceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without Authority (againſt the right both of a Souldier and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) and at laſt to be only diſmiſſed (without any word of Vindication or clearing) ſeems but a ſlender Reparation.</p>

               </gap> the conſequence of it, to render all Souldiers under this Parliament, the worſt of ſlaves, and all ſubjects little better. And though there have been of late in other mens Caſes too many dangerous preſidents of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Petitions, and puniſhing or cenſuring the Petitioners, yet (we thinke) few or none ſo full and clear againſt all juſt Liberties, as this in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116153:20"/>our caſe, whoſe Petition was not, as many (that yet have been received with large thanks) without any foundation in reall grievances or dues, tending and ſerving meerly to declare the Petitioners opinions and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in relation to matters of State (then in tranſaction, or intended to be put on the Parliament) nor yet ſubject to any of thoſe exceptions, which at other Petitions (ſeeming better grounded, more neceſſary or concerning then the former, and yet rejected) might be: But ours not medling with matters of State, with proceedings of Parliament, or any bodies concernements but our owne, tended but to obtaine our particular dues (often promiſed, dearly and fully earned, long forborne) and ſome of which (<hi>viz.</hi> the matter of indempnity) we could not (without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of utter ruine) want after disbanding; and theſe but deſired in an humble and ſubmiſſive way, without any language, ſcandalous or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, or any other particular exception (for matter or forme) that we have ever yet been told of, or could any way learne; ſo as though we are willing to beleeve the Parliament was miſinformed, abuſed or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in the buſineſſes (as the Narrative does expreſſe) yet we cannot hitherto underſtand, from whence ſuch proceedings againſt ſuch a Petition, or againſt us for it, could ariſe, except (in thoſe that moved and drew the Parliam. thereunto) from ſome principles of Malignants envy or diſlike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, the Petitioners for the things God hath done by us, carrying them (above all other conſiderations of juſt or unjuſt, dangerous or ſafe) to this end, as the greateſt good, that this Army muſt not paſſe with that Reputation God had given it, but muſt (upon any occaſion that could be catched hold on) have a diſhonour put upon it, and by diſcontents and provocations be put into diſtemper, ſo as to do ſomething that might render it odious, or bring a blemiſh upon it.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, The declaration yet ſtanding in force, and nothing publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Parliament to cleare the Army from the cenſure it thereby lies under, there remains a brand of Ignominy upon this Army to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And thoſe Souldiers that have proceeded to act any thing in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of their juſt deſires in that Petition, or in Repreſentation of their juſt Grievances thereupon; as alſo thoſe Officers that have any way concurred with, or countenanced, or not deſerted them therein, remain ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to queſtion, and to the higheſt cenſure that may be for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, were all other our greivances duly conſidered, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done to the diſcovery or cenſure of thoſe that have wronged the Army, and abuſed the Parliament, to the procuring of ſuch procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt us, in relation to ſo juſt and innocent Petition, but that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116153:20"/>ſame perſons remaine ſtill in the ſame credit and power, we appeal to all reaſonable men, what hopes, either of right or ſafety (we when disbanded and diſperſed) or any private man, can hereafter promiſe to himſelfe in the like caſe? Let every honeſt Engliſh man lay his hand on his heart, weigh our caſe, and make it his own (as in conſequence it is,) and then judge for us and himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We may confidently ſay; Never any private man had or can have any thing more clearly due to him, then what we went about to petition for; nor could ſeek it in a more regular, humble or inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive way (as hath been ſhewed before:) Now for a private man petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for his right in ſuch a way, to be denied, or faile of his right (in Courts where Corruption ſways) is perhaps not rare; yet for ſuch a man to be debarred or interdicted before-hand from ſuing for his acknowledged right (we thinke) is not uſuall in Courts ſufficiently corrupt: But not only to be denied his right, and the liberty to Petition it, but withall by a cenſure, (no leſſe then Capital) to be expoſed to a forfeiture of Eſtate, Liberty, Life and all, for but going ſo to aske what he conceives, and the Court it ſelfe will not deny, to be his due, and this without ever ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or hearing, what he can ſay in his excuſe, would carry ſo high a face of Injuſtice, Oppreſſion and Tyranny, as we thinke is not eaſie to be exampled in the proceedings of the moſt corrupt and Arbitrary Courts, towards the meaneſt ſingle man. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we have found men of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Principles, and confidence to attempt, and in that credit and power to carry on ſuch proceedings againſt an Army, (ſtanding then in full ſtrength, in reputation, and ſome little merit, alſo) and to engage the Authority of Parliament therein, whoſe preſent power hath, under God, been upheld, and but newly eſtabliſhed through that Army: What can we, or any honeſt man, expect hereafter, as private perſons, if the ſame men ſhall continue to be our Judges, or in the ſame credit and power, when we are disbanded (as now) we ſay, what good can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or what ill may not be expected in any future caſe, that ſhall croſſe the pride, paſſions or intereſts of ſuch men, of whoſe unjuſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and deſperately tyrannicall Spirits, we have in this caſe had the moſt perfect taſte that can be imagined: We have both here and before plainly Remonſtrated our caſe in this particular, as it ſtands, appearing to thoſe that underſtand not upon what grounds, and in what manner ſuch things were carried in the Parliament, in relation to the Petition: We are ſtill willing to beleeve the Parliament hath been ſome way ſtrangely miſinformed, ſurprized, or otherwiſe abuſed in that buſineſſe (as was expreſſed before in that Narrative) We are ſtill tender of Parliament
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116153:21"/>Priviledges; but we ſhall yet hope and deſire, that the wiſdome of the Parliament would had how to diſingage the honour of the Parliament, from the deſperate Practiſes of ſuch Incendiaries, and cauſe them to be diſcovered and cenſured, ſo farre as may ſecure the Parliament from being again ſo abuſed, and both us and the Kingdome from the like or worſe Oppreſſions or Dangers by them, (which is the utmoſt ill we wiſh them:) And if herein our belief or hopes, from or concerning the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, do fail us, we ſhall be ſorry; but yet the caſe and conſequence is ſtill as it is, or the more ſad to us and the Kingdome. And having in this particular expreſſed both the caſe and conſequence very plainly, we leave it at the Parliaments Door, until they ſhall be pleaſed to fix the blame on thoſe particular Perſons that have abuſed them herein, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly and laſtly, We find nothing as yet done, or thought of for Reparation or Vindication of the Army, in reference to the many Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals caſt upon it, or to puniſh or diſcountenance the Authors and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers, though divers of them be ſufficently known.</p>

            <p>It cannot be unknowne what hath paſſed betwixt the Parliament and Army, as to the ſervice of <hi>Ireland;</hi> by all which, together with the late proceedings againſt the Army, in relation to their Petition and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances all men may judge, what hath hindred the Army from a ready en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in that ſervice, and without further accompt or Apology as to that particular, then what thoſe paſſages and proceedings themſelves (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made publick) do afford, we do appeale to your ſelves whether thoſe courſes, to which the Parliament hath (by the deſignes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſome) been drawn, have rationally tended, to induce a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unanimous undertaking of the Army to that ſervice, or rather to breake and pull the Army in peeces with diſcontent and diſhonour, and to put ſuch diſ-obligations, and provocations upon it, as might drive it into diſtemper, and indeed diſcourage both this Army, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Souldiers from any further engagement in the Parliaments ſervice. And we wiſh all men would (with us) upon the whole carriage, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, whether (in the intentions of thoſe who have by falſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and miſ-repreſentations put the Parliament upon ſuch wayes) the timely and effectuall reliefe of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſeem really to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or rather with the breaking or disbanding of this Army,) to draw together or raiſe ſuch other forces, and of ſuch a temper as might ſerve to ſome deſperate and deſtructive deſignes in <hi>England;</hi> For which (beſides the probable ſuſpitions from their carriage of the buſineſſe) wee have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand in the tranſaction thereof had more then hints of ſuch a deſigne by clear expreſſions to that purpoſe, from many of thoſe Officers of the Army, that have been perſwaded, and appeared moſt forward to engage as for <hi>Ireland</hi> on the termes propoſed: And that ſuch a deſigne hath all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long been driven, ſeemes now too evident by the preſent diſpoſing of thoſe Forces that have been engaged for <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the endeavours of ſome
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116153:22"/>to gaine a power from the Parliament of ordering thoſe Forces for ſome ſervice in <hi>England,</hi> and by the private liſtings of men for ſervice here, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any publike authority of Parliament. And (all this) by the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have all along appeared moſt active and violent in the late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the Army.</p>
            <p>As to the juſt Diſcontents and Diſſatisfactions of the Army in relation to their Grievances, and their Non-compliance to the late Orderers for ſudden Disbanding by peece-meale, before more full and equall ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were given to the whole,) we deſire you to look back to the Papers already publiſhed of the grievances themſelves, the <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and to the later Papers from the generall Counſell of War at <hi>Bury,</hi> and the late generall Randezvous neer <hi>New-Market;</hi> And, we thinke, your late reſuming the conſideration of thoſe things, as to a further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, doth much juſtifie the deſires and proceedings of the Army, in thoſe paſt particulars hitherto.</p>
            <p>And though, had we upon our firſt addreſſes, for our undoubted rights and dues<hi rend="sup">c</hi> found a free and candid reception, with a juſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a reaſonable ſatisfaction, or at leaſt a free Anſwer therein, we ſhould have been eaſily perſwaded to have abated or forborn much of our dues, and not to have enquired into or conſidered, ſo farre as we have, either the poſſibilities there are for more preſent ſatisfaction of Arrears, or the credit of future Securities propoſed: yet ſince upon theſe former Addreſſes we have found ſuch hard dealing as in the ſaid Papers is ſet forth, and thoſe additionall, though hitherto but partial, ſatisfactions, comming ſo hardly as they have; we find no obliging reaſons, in the leaſt, to decline or recede from what's our due, but rather ſtill to adhere unto our deſires of full and equall ſatisfaction in all the things mentioned in the aforeſaid Papers; not only in behalfe of our ſelves and the Army, but alſo of the whole Souldiery throughout the Kingdome, who have concurred or ſhall concurre with us in the ſame deſires. And to all our former Deſires at Souldiers we cannot but adde this, (wherein we find our ſelves ſo neerly concerned in point of Juſtice and reputation) That more care and a ſtricter courſe may be taken for making good, all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles granted upon Surrenders, according to the true intent and meaning of them; at alſo for remedy and reparation, in caſe of any breach, and this without thoſe delays which divers have found as prejudiciall to them, or more then if they had been totally denied the performance of them.</p>
            <p>Nor will it now (we hope) ſeem ſtrange or unreaſonable to rationall and honeſt men, who conſider the conſequence of our preſent caſe, to their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116153:22"/>own and the Kingdomes, (as well as our) future concernments in point of Right, Freedome, Peace and ſafety, (if from a deep ſenſe of the high conſequence of our preſent caſe, both to our ſelves (in future) and all other people) we ſhall, before disbanding, proceed in our owne and the Kingdoms behalfe, to propound and plead for ſome proviſion for our and the Kingdoms ſatisfaction and future ſecurity, in relation to thoſe things, eſpecially conſidering that we were not a meer mercenary Army hired to ſerve any Arbitrary power of a State, but called forth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the ſeverall Declarations of Parliament, to the defence of our owne and the peoples juſt Rights and Liberties; and ſo we took up Armes in judgement and conſcience to thoſe ends, and have ſo continued them, and are reſolved according to your firſt juſt deſires in your Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and ſuch principles as we have received from your frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, and our own common ſenſe, concerning thoſe our funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental rights and liberties, to aſſert and vindicate the juſt power and rights of this Kingdome in Parliament for thoſe common ends premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt all arbitrary power, violence and oppreſſion, and againſt all particular parties or intereſts whatſoever. The ſaid Declarations ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting us to the equitable ſenſe of all Laws and Conſtitutions, as diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the very letter of the ſame, and being ſupreme to it, when the ſafety and preſervation of all is concerned; And aſſuring us that all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is fundamentally ſeated in the Office, and but miniſterially in the Perſons. Neither do or will theſe our proceedings (as we are fully and in conſcience perſwaded) amount to any thing not warrantable before God and men; being, thus far, much ſhort of the common proceedings in other Nations, to things of an higher nature then we have yet appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to; and we cannot but be ſenſible of the great complaints that have been made to us generally in the Kingdome from the people where we march, of Arbitrarineſſe and Injuſtice, to their great and inſupportable oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>And truly ſuch Kingdomes as have according both to the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Nations appeared to the vindication and defence of their juſt Rights and Liberties, have proceeded much higher, as our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who in the firſt beginning of theſe late differences aſſociated in Covenant, from the very ſame grounds and principles (having no viſible form, either of Parliament or King to countenance them) And as they were therein juſtified and protected by their own and this Kingdome alſo, ſo we juſtly ſhall expect to be.</p>
            <p>We need not mention the States of the Netherlands, the Portugals, and others, all proceeding upon the ſame Principles of right and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116153:23"/>And accordingly the Parliament hath declared it no reſiſting of Magiſtracy, to ſide with the juſt principles and law of nature and Nations, being that law upon which we have aſſiſted you, and that the ſouldiery may lawfully hold the hands of the Generall who will turne his Cannon againſt his Army on purpoſe to deſtroy them, the Seamen the hands of that Pilot, who wilfully rune the Ship upon a rock, (as our Brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> argued:) And ſuch were the proceedings of our Anceſtors of famous memory, to the purchaſing of ſuch Rights and Liberties, as they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed through the price of their bloud, and we (both by that and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bloud of our deare friends, and fellow Souldiers with the hazard of our own, do now lay claim unto.</p>
            <p>Nor is that ſupreme end, the glory of God, wanting in theſe caſes, to ſet a price upon all ſuch proceedings of righteouſneſſe and juſtice, it being one witneſſe of God in the world, to carry on a Teſtimony againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and unrighteouſneſſe of men, and againſt the miſcarriage of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, when corrupted or declining from their Primitive and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we mention, but to compare proceedings, and to ſhow that we are ſo much the more juſtifiable, and warranted, in what we do, by how much we come ſhort of that height and meaſure of proceedings, which the people in free Kingdomes and Nations have formerly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed.</p>
            <p>Now having thus farre cleared our way in this buſineſſe, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to propound ſuch things as we do humbly deſire for the ſetling and ſecuring of our owne and the Kingdomes common right, freedome, peace, and ſafety as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Houſes may be ſpeedily purged of ſuch Members as for their delinquency or for Corruptions, or abuſe to the State or undue E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections ought not to ſit there, whereof the late Elections in <hi>Cornwall, Wales,</hi> and other parts of the Kingdome afford too many examples, to the great prejudice of the peoples freedome in the ſaid Elections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe perſons, who have, in the late unjuſt and high procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt the Army appeared to have the wil, the confidence, credit and power, to abuſe the Parliament and the Army, and endanger the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in carrying on ſuch things againſt us (while an Army, may be ſome way ſpeedily diſabled from doing the like or worſe to us) when disbanded and diſperſt, and in the condition of private men) or to other the free-born people of <hi>England</hi> in the ſame condition with us, and that for that purpoſe the ſame perſons may not continue in the ſame power (eſpecially as our and the Kingdome Judges in the higheſt truſt) but may be made incapable thereof for the future.</p>

            <p>And if it be queſtioned who theſe are, we thought not fit particularly to name them in this our Repreſentation to you, but ſhall very ſpeedily give in their names; and before long ſhall offer what we have to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to your Commiſſioners, wherein we hope ſo to carry our ſelves, as that the World ſhall ſee we aime at nothing of private revenge and animoſities, but that juſtice may have a free courſe, and the Kingdome be eaſed, and ſecured by diſmabling ſuch men (at leaſt) from places of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, who deſiring to advantage, and ſet up themſelves and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a generall confuſion, have endeavoured to put the Kingdome into a new flame of war, then which nothing is more abhorrent to us.</p>
            <p>But becauſe neither the granting of this alone would be ſufficient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our own and the Kingdoms rights, liberties, and ſafety, either for the preſent age or poſterity; nor would our Propoſals of this ſingly be free from the ſcandall and appearance of faction or deſignes only to weaken one Party (under the notion of unjuſt or oppreſſive) that we may advance another (which may be imagined more our own) We therefore declare, That indeed we cannot but wiſh, that ſuch men, and ſuch onely, might be preferred to the great power and truſt of the Common-wealth, as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, at leaſt for morall righteouſneſſe; and of ſuch we cannot but in our wiſhes preferre thoſe, that appeare acted thereunto by a principle of Conſcience and Religion in them. And accordingly we doe and ever ſhall bleſſe God for thoſe many ſuch Worthies, who, through his providence have been choſen into this Parliament; And, to ſuch mens endeavours (under God) we cannot but attribute that Vindication, (in part) of the peoples Rights and Liberties, and thoſe beginnings of a juſt Reformation, which the firſt proceedings of this Parliam appeared to have driven at, and tended to, though of late obſtructed, or rather diverted to other ends and intereſt by the prevailing of other perſons of other principles and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But yet we are ſo far from deſigning, or complying to have an abſolute or Arbitrary power fixed or ſetled for continuance, in any perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as that (if we might be ſure to obtain it) we canot wiſh to have it ſo in the perſons of any, whom we could moſt confide in, or who ſhould appear moſt of our own opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and principles, or whom we might have moſt perſonall aſſurance of, or intereſt in, but we doe, and ſhall much rather wiſh, that the Authority of this Kingdome in Parliaments (rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, that is, freely, equally and ſucceſſively choſen according to its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall intention) may ever ſtand and have its courſe. And therefore we ſhall apply our deſires, chiefly to ſuch things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as (by having Parliaments ſetled in ſuch a right Conſtitution) may give moſt ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es of Juſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116153:24"/>to flow downe, equally to all, in that its ancient Channell, without any Overtures, tending either to overthrow, that foundation of Order and Government in this Kingdome, or to ingroſſe that power for perpetuity into the hands of any particular perſons, or party what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oever.</p>
            <p>And for that purpoſe, though (as we have found it doubted by many men, minding ſincerely the publick good, but not weighing ſo fully all conſequences of things) it may and is not unlike to prove, that, upon the ending of this Parliament, and the Election of New, the Conſtitution of ſucceeding Parliaments, (as to the perſons Elected) may prove for the worſe many wayes; yet ſince neither in the preſent purging of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, nor in the Election of New, we cannot promiſe to our ſelves, or the Kingdome, an aſſurance of Juſtice, or other poſitive good from the hands of men, but thoſe who for preſent appeare moſt righteous and moſt for common good (having an unlimited power fixed in them during life or pleaſure) in time, may become corrupt, or ſettle into parties, or factions; or, on the other ſide, in caſe of new Elections, thoſe that ſhould ſo ſucceed, may prove as bad or worſe then the former. We therefore humbly conceive that, (of two inconveniences the leſſe being to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen) the maine thing to be intended in this caſe (and beyond which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane providence cannot reach, as to any aſſurance of poſitive good) ſeemes to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> to provide, that however unjuſt or corrupt the perſons of Parliament-men, in preſent or future may prove; or whatever ill they may do to particular parties (or to the whole in particular things,) during their reſpective terms, or periods, yet they ſhall not have the temptation or advantage of an unlimited power fixt in them during their owne pleaſures, whereby to perpetuate injuſtice and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon any (without end or remedy,) or to advance and uphold any one particular party, faction or intereſt whatſoever, to the oppreſſion or prejudice of the Communitie, and the enſlaving of the Kingdome, unto all poſterity, but that the people may have an equall hope, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, if they have made an ill choice at one time, to mend it in another; and the members of the Houſe themſelves may be in a capacity, to taſt of ſubjection as well as rule, and may ſo be inclined to conſider of other mens caſes, as what may come to be their owne. This we ſpeak of, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> as being entruſted, on the peoples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, for their intereſt in that great and ſupreame power of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, (viz. the Legiſlative power, with the power of finall judgement,) which being, in its owne nature, ſo arbitrary, and in a manner unlimited, (unleſſe in point of time) is moſt unfit and dangerous (as to the peoples
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116153:24"/>intereſt) to be fixt in the perſons of the ſame men during life, or their owne pleaſures. Neither by the originall Conſtitution of this State, was it, or ought it to continue ſo, nor does it (where ever it is, and continues ſo) render that State any better then a meere Tyranny) or the people ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, any better then Vaſſals: But in all States, where there is any face of common freedome, and particularly in this State of <hi>England</hi> (as is moſt evident, both by many poſitive Lawes, and ancient conſtant cuſtome) the people have a right to new and ſucceſſive Elections unto that great and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme truſt, at certaine periods of time, which is ſo eſſentiall and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to their freedome, as it is, cannot, or ought not to be denied them, or with-held from them, and without which the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is of very little concernment to the intereſt of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> Yet in this we would not be miſ-underſtood, in the leaſt, to blame thoſe Worthies of both Houſes, whoſe zeale to vindicate the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Nation, did procure that Act for continuance of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereby it was ſecured from being diſſolved at the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, (as former Parliaments had been) or reduced to ſuch a certainty, as might enable them the better to aſſert and vindicate the Liberties of this Nation, (immediatly before ſo highly invaded, and then alſo ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.) And theſe we take to be the principall ends and grounds, for which, in that exigency of time and affaires, it was procured, and to which we acknowledge it hath happily been made uſe of; but we cannot thinke it was by thoſe Worthies intended, or ought to be made uſe of to the perpetuating of thai ſupreme truſt and power in the perſons of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their owne pleaſures, or to the debarring of the people from their right of Elections (totally new) when thoſe dangers or exigencies were paſt, and the affaires and ſafety of the Common-wealth would admit of ſuch a change.</p>

               <hi>Having thus cleared our Grounds and Intentions (as we hope) from all ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and miſunderſtandings, in what followes we ſhall proceed further to propoſe what we humbly deſire for the ſetling and ſecuring of our owne and the Kingdomes Rights and Liberties (through the bleſſing of God) to poſterity; and therefore, upon all the Grounds premiſed, we further humbly deſire as followeth;</hi>

This we deſire may be now provided for (if it may be) ſo as to put it out of all diſpute, for future, though we thinke of right, it ought not to have been otherwiſe before.</p>
            <p>And this a firme foundation being laid in the authority and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliaments for the hopes, at leaſt, of common and equall right and freedome to our ſelves and all the free-born people of this Land; we ſhall for our parts freely and chearfully commit our ſtock or ſhare of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this Kingdome, into this common bottome of Parliaments, and though it may (for our particulars) go ill with us in one Voyage, yet we ſhall thus hope (if right be with us) to fare better in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we deſire may be provided for, by Bill or Ordinance of Parliament to which the Royall aſſent may be deſired: when his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in theſe things, and what elſe ſhall be propoſed by the Parliament, neceſſary for ſecuring the Rights and Liberties of the people, and for ſetling the <hi>Militia</hi> and peace of the Kingdome, ſhall have given his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to put them paſt diſpute.

            <p>More particularly (under this head) we cannot but deſire, that all ſuch as are impriſoned, for any pretended miſdemeanor, may be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſpeedy way for a juſt hearing and triall, and ſuch as ſhall appeare to have been unjuſtly and unduly impriſoned, may (with their liberty) have ſome reaſonable reparation according to their ſufferings, and the demerit of their oppreſſors.</p>

            <p n="8">8.

            <p>There are (beſides theſe) many particular things which we could wiſh to be done, and ſome to be undone; all, in order ſtill to the ſame ends,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116153:26"/>of common right; freedome, peace, and ſafety. But theſe propoſals afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, being the principall things we bottome and inſiſt upon, we ſhall (as we have ſaid before) for our parts acquieſce for other particulars in the Wiſedome and Iuſtice of Parliaments.

            <p>We have thus freely and clearely declared the depth and bottome of our hearts and deſires in order to the Rights, Liberties and peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wherein we appeale to all men, whether we ſeek any thing of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our ſelves, or any particular party whatever, to the prejudice of the whole, and whether the things we wiſh and ſeek, do not equally concerne and conduce to the good of others in common with our ſelves, according to the ſincerity of our deſires and intentions (wherein as we have already found the concurrent ſence of the People in divers Counties by their Petitions to the Generall, expreſſing their deepe repreſentment of theſe things, and preſſing us to ſtand for the Intereſt of the Kingdome therein, ſo, we ſhall wiſh and expect to find the unanimous concurrence of all others, who are equally concerned with us in theſe things, and wiſh well to the publick.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:116153:28"/>or our ſelves, or as may prevent the preſent Deſignes and practiſes ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently indangering the Peace of this Nation, if thoſe ſame perſons (who have notoriouſly appeared moſt active in all the late proceedings, to the prejudice and provocation of the Army, and hazarding thus farre the Peace of the Kingdom) ſhall continue in the ſame power Judges of thoſe things relating to the Armies ſatisfaction, and peace of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

And though our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of theſe things ſeemes not regular, yet being ſo publickly done, we thought fit to mind you of them.</p>
               <p>Now although we have confidence of the reall and cleare intentions of your Lordſhip, the Aldermen, and the Commons of your City to promote the peace of this Kingdome, and the juſt deſires of this Army; Alſo to prevent all tendencles to a new War, or any further blood, and therefore hold our ſelves obliged to yeeld all poſſible complyance to what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

               <p>We (upon the whole matter) offer to yours, and all mens Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whether with yours, ours, or the publick Safety, we can remove further backeward, untill upon yours, and our joint endeavours with the Parliament, thoſe things of immediate, and preſſing neceſſitie be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, which we deſired in our Paper laſt given in to the Parliaments Commiſſioners in order to the better proceeding upon the Heads of the Repreſentation and Charge, with more hopes of ſafety, and of a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happy iſſue to our ſelves, and the Kingdome, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons impeached by us, may not continue in power and capacity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct due proceedings againſt themſelves: And for their owne eſcape from juſtice to threaten ruine to the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>That all forces lately raiſed or liſted in, or about the City, may be forthwith diſcharged, except the uſuall number of Trained Bands and Auxiliaries, and that all endeavours publickly or privately to raiſe any further forces may ceaſe and be ſuppreſt.</p>
               <p>And that the ſame meaſure may be allowed to this Army, in paying them up to the ſame foot of accompt, as is already given to thoſe who have deſerted the ſame.</p>

We wiſh the name of priviledges may not lie in the ballance with the ſafety of a Kingdome, and the reality of doing juſtice, which as we have ſaid too often, we cannot expect whilſt the perſons we have accuſed are the Kingdomes and our Iudges; A little delay will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the putting the Kingdome into bloud, notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid, if it be conſidered that in <hi>Wales</hi> (beſides under-hand workings in your City) and other places, men are raiſed, and that in no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

               <p>Laſtly, we did with theſe deliver in another paper (whereof here is a Copy annexed) containing divers juſt and neceſſary things which we did deſire might be provided for, and done for the better proceeding in the Premiſſes with more ſafety to our ſelves and the Kingdome, and with more aſſurance or hopes of a timely and happy iſſue.</p>
               <p>To which things deſired (which we ſuppoſe all men reaſonable will thinke juſt and neceſſary,) we have yet received no Anſwer or reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor can find any conſideration at all had of them; ſave that a Moneths pay is ſent downe to the <hi>Army,</hi> whilſt thoſe that have deſerted the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> receive at <hi>London</hi> much more, and that ſome Votes have been paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the annulling the Committee pretended for ſafety about li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of men, and drawing of Forces together; which Votes we find rendred but vaine and deluſive by the continued under-hand practiſes of thoſe whom we have charged, and their accomplices in liſting and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging men for a new Warre, and by a later dayes Votes, not admitting
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116153:32"/>that the Forces ſo liſted or ingaged ſhould by publick Order be diſmiſt or diſcharged: which with other things we cannot but attribute chiefly to the prevalent influence of the ſame perſons.</p>
               <p>Now whereas we find that our firſt deſire in the Paper laſt mentioned (for preſent ſuſpending the perſons impeached from ſitting in the Houſe) is judged by ſome to be againſt the courſe and priviledge of Parliament, or of ill conſequence in the preſident of it, (the charge being but general, and no particular proofes as yet produced to render the proceedings Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall) we cannot but remind the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That as the moſt and maine things charged (with the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and conſequences of them) ſo the conſtant and continued activity of all or moſt of the perſons charged in relation thereunto, (in miſinforming, deluding, abuſing or ſuppriſing the Houſe, and otherwiſe, are ſufficiently knowne to the Parliament it ſelfe,) ſo as the Houſe might upon their own paſt and preſent cognizance of the ſame, moſt juſtly proceed to ſuſpend them,) as (in many other caſes upon farre leſſe occaſions which never could have produced ſuch ſad effects to the Kingdome,) they have done many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Members meerly for words ſpoken of things moved in the Houſe alledged to be but againſt Order or Cuſtome of the Houſe, and this without any tryall, proofe or charge, but meerly upon the Houſes owne cognizance of the things, as we could inſtance in many caſes ſince this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament began.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas many of the things to which the Charge relates, are things ſpoken, moved or done in the Houſe, ſo as yet we have no clear way opened particularly to charge or mention them, or to produce proof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to them, without ſome pretence againſt us of breach of priviledge, and therefore (though we think no priviledge ought to protect wicked men in doing wrong to particulate, or miſchiefe to the publiq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, yet) we have been hitherto ſo tender of Parliament priviledges, as that we have onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the evill of ſuch things done, and ſuppoſing the Houſe to have beene (as we did, and doe beleeve, and if way were open, without breach of priviledge, ſhould not doubt to prove it was) ſome wayes miſinformed, deluded, ſurprized, or otherwiſe abuſed in theſe things by evil Members, we have frequently in former papers, (before the Charge) put the Parliament upon it, (who without colour of breach of priviludge might doe it,) to finde out and diſcover who they were that had ſo abuſed them, and to diſingage the honour of Parliament from the evill practiſes and deſignes of ſuch Inſendiaries.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the ſame difficulties or prejudices lye yet in our way, (as to the particular charging or proofe of ſuch things againſt Members,)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116153:33"/>And the Parliament (though ſo often put upon it in our former Papers, yet through the powerfull intereſt of the perſons guilty,) hath not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any cognizance what Members or others have ſo abuſed them, to draw the Parliament to ſuch diſhonour and inconveniences, we cannot but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine more fully and clearely aſſert (as we have in former Papers, and ſhall more particularly if need be, remonſtrate) that divers things late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done and paſſed from the Parliament againſt this Army, (as particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Order for ſuppreſſing the Petition, that high Declaration againſt it, and againſt all that ſhould proceed in it, putting the faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Parliament and Kingdome out of the protection of the Law and expoſing them as enemies to the State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the forfeiture of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Liberties, Life and all, but for going about in an humble, peaceable and inoffenſive way, to deſire what was undeniably their doe, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earned, and many other ſuch like proceedings both againſt the Army and others,) do carry with them ſuch a face of injuſtice, oppreſſion, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarineſſe and tyranny, as (we thinke) is not to be paralleld in any former proceedings of the moſt Arbitrary Courts againſt any private men, but have brought inſufferable diſhonour upon the Parliament, (which we are, and others ought to be deeply ſenſible of,) hath tended to diſoblige all men, eſpecially Souldiers from the ſame, to deſtroy all juſt freedome either of Souldiers or Subjects, and hath conduced to all other the ſad effects and worle conſequences, expreſſed in the Charge, and gives us and others cauſe to conclude that thoſe worthies, who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acted and carried on things in Parliament for Publick good, Right and freedome, are now awed or over-borne by a prevailing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men of other private intereſts crept in, and that neither we nor any other can reaſonably expect right, freedome or ſafety (as private men) or to have things acted in Parliament for publick good while the ſame perſons continue there in the ſame power to abuſe the name and authority of Parliament, to ſerve and proſecute their private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and paſſions; and (under the priviledges of Parliament) to ſhelter themſelves under the worſt of evils or miſchiefes they can doe, though to the ruine of the Kingdome. We are in this caſe forc'd (to our great grief of heart) thus plainly to aſſert the preſent evill and miſcheif, together with the future worſe conſequences of the things lately done even in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelfe, (which are too evident and viſible to all.) And ſo (in their proper colours) to lay the ſame at the Parliaments doores, untill the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhall be pleaſed either of themſelves to take notice and ridde the Houſe of thoſe who have any way miſinformed, deluded, ſurpriſed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe abuſed the Parliament to the paſſing ſuch foule things there, or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116153:33"/>ſhall open to us and others ſome way how we may (regularly and without the ſcandall of breaking priviledges, come to charge and proſecute thoſe particular perſons, that (in truth) have ſo abuſed the Parliament, (as well as our ſelves) even for thoſe miſinformations, and other evill and indirect practiſes or proceedings in Parliament, whereby they have ſo abuſed the ſame (as in our ſaid Charge and former papers is ſet forth.</p>
               <p>And here (if we may) we ſhould humbly offer to conſideration whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not a neceſſary expedient, for prevention or remedy of ſuch evils in future, that in things ſo clearly deſtructive to the common Rights and Liberties of the people, and the ſafety of the Kingdome, there ſhould be a liberty for diſſenting Members in the Houſe of Commons (as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Houſe of Peeres) to enter their diſſent, and thereby to acquit themſelves from guilt and blame of what evill may enſue, that ſo the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may regularly come to know who they are that performe their truſt faithfully, and who not. And this proviſion for the future, (as alſo our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for remedy in the preſent caſes) as it were clearly good and neceſſary in the reſpects premiſed, ſo (we think) the ſame may well be without future prejudice or diſcouragement in any other reſpects to ſucceeding Members of Parliament. Providing alwayes that no man ſhall be queſtioned or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for any thing ſaid or done in Parliament any further then to exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from that truſt, which is all that in the preſent caſe we ſhould deſire upon any ſuch grounds. And that future liberty of entring diſſents we do not here propoſe as a thing we any way inſiſt on to the prejudice of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament priviledges, we only offer it to conſideration, and that from good wiſhes to the priviledges of Parliament, to render them more laſting by being leſſe nocent. And indeed whoever moſt adores or tenders thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, will beſt expreſſe his zeale towards them in taking care they be not abuſed or extended to private wrong or publike miſcheif. (For wee clearly finde and all wiſe men may ſee it) that Parliament priviledges, as well as Royall-prerogative, may be perverted and abuſed to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe greater ends for whoſe protection and preſervation they were admitted or intended (viz.) the Rights &amp; Liberties of the people and ſafety of the whole) and in caſe they be ſo, the abuſe, evill, or danger of them is no leſſe to be contended againſt, and a remedy the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>of no leſſe to be endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then of the other.</p>
               <p>And whereas the injuſtice (in that particular of the Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Army for the juſt and innocent Petition) may ſeeme to have beene recompenſed in the late expunging thereof out of the Journall books. We confeſſe it had been ſo in great meaſure, as to the particular or preſent injury done to the Army therein, and (we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116153:34"/>therefore the juſtice that lies in thoſe Votes for expunging thereof, and for our owne or the Armies particular reparation, we ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſh more, nor ſcarce have inſiſted on ſo much to any diſhonour of Parliaments in future, and we ſhould rather have been ſatisfied with the Parliaments declaring how, and by whom they have been miſinformed, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, or otherwiſe abuſed in the framing, propoſal or paſſing thereof as it was, but as to that particular, or any other of that nature, we ſay as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We never did nor doe value or regard our owne injury or repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any compariſon to the conſequence of the one, to the prejudice of the other, or to the future ſecurity of common right and freedome in this Nation, And accordingly we doe not account any reparation conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that extends but to our ſelves in the preſent caſe, and does not in ſome ſort ſecure our ſelves, and all others from danger of the ſame or worſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or oppreſſions, (as private men from the wils and paſſions of the ſame perſons that have offered and acted ſuch things againſt us while an Army.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We cannot but imagine and conſider (according to generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) how the expunging of that Declaration was carried and obtained, and upon what grounds and intentions it was given way to, but had thoſe that procured it been all for expunging it (and that freely) yet how can we expect better but that the ſame men who at one time carried ſuch a Declaration, and another time expung'd it, may the next day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the like or worſe (upon any occaſion wherein it may ſerve their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ends or intereſts) if they continue in the ſame power and ſway and be let paſſe in deluding and ſurpriſing the Parliament as they have done in the paſt particulars.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The apparent diſhonour and prejudice brought upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in having ſuch a Declaration ſo paſſed as they ſhould ſoone after, (without any alteration) in the pretended ground of it find cauſe (for ſhame of the world) to expunge (we thinke) ſhould engage thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that love Parliaments in point of honour, to find out and diſcover, how, and by whom the Parliament had been abuſed or otherwiſe brought into ſuch an inconveniency. And the Parliament may in this ſee the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (as by-ſtanders doe the prevalence) of thoſe Members that abuſed the Parliament in that Declaration, who will and can make the authority of Parliament ſtill lie under the diſhonour of it (in a bare expunging or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting) rather then to admit any conſideration to acquit the authority of Parliament that would tend to ſix the blame on thoſe particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that had deſerted it. And this certainly will be admitted and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116153:34"/>done rather then to ſlight it over in a bare expunging, were not ſome men more tender of, and more ſwayed with ſuch conſiderations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences as may tend to the prejudice of perſons, then ſuch as tend to the generall prejudice and diſhonour of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>As to theſe particulars included in our charge, which depend on things done without the Parliament, we are ready, and ſhould moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, proceed in the particular charging and proving thereof if (firſt from the Juſtice of the Houſe in a preſent proceeding againſt the perſons charged for thoſe things that are already known to the Houſe being done in it) we could find incouragement to expect any good iſſue upon thoſe other things, and did we not (on the contrary) find that (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what is ſo knowne to the Houſe as before expreſſed) the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons continue in ſuch power and prevalence both in the Houſe, and in all Committees of the higheſt truſt, as leaves little hope of Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Army or Kingdome in other things, and much leſſe in any juſt proceeding againſt themſelves, while they continue Judges of their owne and our concernements, ſo as we cannot, while they remaine in the ſame power, expect any other but a continued perverting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of all things (and eſpecially of thoſe delays which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proceeding againſt them would neceſſarily induce) altogether to our owne and the Kingdomes prejudice and danger diſable or weaken us for thoſe things, which the ſafety and ſetling of the Rights, Liberties, and peace of the Kingdome requires: And to ſtrengthen themſelves by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand practiſes and preparations both at home and abroad the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that leave little hopes of Iuſtice to our ſelves or the Kingdome (while they continue in the ſame power,) and render all delayes dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deſtructive to ourſelves and peace of the Kingdome, we ſhould be contented that the buſineſſe concerning the Members we have charged ſhould be laid aſide, till thoſe other things were firſt ſetled, which our Declaration does propound for the common Rights and Liberties of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>But finding things ſtill ſo carried as they are, and as we have before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and that while they are Judges in their owne cauſes they (with that party which they make) will do what they pleaſe, and yet render it a breach of Priviledge to be accuſed for it, we cannot but upon all theſe conſiderations and for all the reaſons before expreſt inſiſt upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the members charged may firſt be forthwith ſuſpended from fitting in the

               <p>As to our deſire of having the Army preſently paid up equally with thoſe that have deſerted it, we appeale to all men for the Iuſtice, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſſe, and neceſſity thereof.</p>
               <p>The Iuſtice in that the former ſervice (for which there arrears are due) hath been (at leaſt) as faithfully and diligently performed by the Army as by thoſe late deſerters of it, and in our preſent poſture (though they have appeared indeed more officious and ſerviceable to the intereſt and will of particular men then we, yet we are ſure) the Army is and (we hope) will at laſt appear to be more faithfull to the true intereſts of Parliaments and the Kingdome (which we were at firſt called out and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for) then they in deſerting the Army have hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
               <p>For the reaſonableneſſe of our deſires though we have ground to claim more then they, or rather that they or ſome of them ſhould forfeit their Arrears; yet we aske (for preſent) but equall, nor ſhould we (at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) inſiſt much on that (as to Officers) if our Souldiers were but firſt paid up.

And though for theſe things the actors of them have no preſent publick authority, yet they have ſome way, ſuch countenance or aſſiſtance to be juſtified in Parliament, (if queſtioned for it) as that they have the confidence to act openly, ſince they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their Emiſſaries or Agents abroad in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and other Countries, very active to draw in ſorraine Forces for their aſſiſtance; ſince in the mean time, they are endeavouring by Spies and ſecret agents in all our Quarters, to inveigle and invite the Souldiers of this Army to deſert their Officers and come to <hi>London,</hi> and for that purpoſe do improve the advantage of the Order or Declaration of Parliament afore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for ſatisfaction of Arreares to ſuch as ſhall deſert the Army.

               <p>I Was ſent unto by the King on Friday laſt, to deſire the Parliament to give way to Him to ſee his children; and that they might for that purpoſe be ſent to Him: If I may be bold humbly to offer my Opinion, I thinke the allowance of ſuch a thing may be without the leaſt prejudice
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116153:39"/>to the Kingdome, and yet gain more upon his Majeſtie then denying it; and if it be in the prayers of every good man, that his heart may be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the performance of ſuch civilities to him is very ſurable to thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and will heare well with all men, who (if they can imagine it to be their own caſe) cannot but be ſorry, if His Majeſties naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to His Children, in ſo ſmall a thing ſhould not be complyed with, and if any queſtion ſhould be concerning the aſſurance of their returne, I ſhall ingage for their return within what time the Parliament ſhall limit.</p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion give me leave, I beſeech you, to take notice of ſome reports ſpread abroad, as if my ſelfe and the Officers of the Army were upon ſome under-hand Contract or Bargaine with the King; and from thence occaſion is taken to ſlander our Integrities, and endeavour a miſunderſtanding betwixt the Parliament and their Army, the fidelity of which to the Parliament and Kingdome, and their affection to it, are the great objects of many mens Envies, becauſe they ſee nothing ſo likely to ſettle Right and Freedome, with Truth and Peace to us and Poſterity, and to hinder their Deſigns againſt the ſame, as an Harmony or good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between the Parliament and Army, which is the joy of good men, and it ſhall be our ſtudy to preſerve againſt all Deſignes and Deſigners to the contrary.</p>
               <p>To prevent therefore all miſunderſtandings of that kinde, I thought fit with all clearneſſe to declare unto you, That we have done nothing, nor ſhall do any thing which we deſire to hide from you or the world, or ſhall not avow to the faces of our greateſt Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Our Deſires concerning a juſt conſideration and ſettlement of the Kings Rights (His Majeſty firſt giving His concurrence to ſettle and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdome) We have already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely declared in our Repreſentation and Remonſtrance. Since the firſt of thoſe Papers ſent to the Parliament, there have been ſeverall Officers of the Army upon ſeverall occaſions ſent to His Majeſty, the firſt to preſent to Him a Copy of the Repreſentation, and after that ſome others to tender Him a copy of the Remonſtrance; upon both which, the Officers ſent were appointed to clear the ſence and intention of any thing in either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whereupon His Majeſty might make any queſtion. Since then, there have alſo been ſome Officers at ſeverall times ſent to His Majeſty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout His remove from <hi>Hatfield,</hi> to diſſwade (if poſſibly) from <hi>Windſor</hi> or any place ſo near <hi>London,</hi> to ſome place of further diſtance, anſwerable to what we had deſired of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>In all which addreſſes to his Majeſty, we care not who knowes what hath been ſaid or done; for as we have nothing to bargaine for or to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116153:40"/>ask, either from His Majeſty or the Parliament, for advantage to our ſelves, or any particular party or intereſt of our own; ſo in all thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to His Majeſty, we have utterly diſclaimed and diſavowed any ſuch thing, or any Overtures or Thoughts tending that way; but the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent and effect of thoſe our Addreſſes hath been, to deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor His Majeſties free concurrence with the Parliament, for eſtabliſhing and ſecuring the common Rights and Liberties, and ſetling the peace of the Kingdome; And to aſſure Him. That (the publick being ſo provided for, with ſuch His Majeſties concurrence) it is fully agreeable to all our Principles, and ſhould be our deſires and indeavour, That (with, and in ſuch ſetling of the Publick) the Rights of His Majeſties Royall Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be alſo provided for, ſo as a laſting Peace and Agreement might be ſetled in this Nation: And that, as we had publickly declared for the ſame in generall terms, ſo (if things came to a way of ſettlement) we ſhould not be wanting (in our ſphaeres) to owne that Generall Deſire, in any particulars of natural or civill right to His Majeſties perſon or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which might not prejudice or againe indanger the Publick, and in the meane time, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t his Majeſtie ſhould find all perſonall civilities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects from us, with all reaſonable freedome that might ſtand with ſafety, and with the truſt or charge lying upon us concerning His Perſon.</p>
               <p>You have here the utmoſt ſum of what hath paſſed from us to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and we could wiſh all men did rightly underſtand (without miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations) every particular wherein (as we know nothing not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reaſon, Juſtice, Honeſty, or Conſcience, ſo) we thought our ſelves concerned the rather to ſay and doe, as we have towards his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſince He came within our Quarters, becauſe of thoſe common preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices ſuggeſted againſt us, as if we were utter Enemies to Monarchy, and all Civill Order and Government.</p>
               <p>And for that particular of the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and the Two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains lately permitted to attend His Majeſty, It was not done without much reluctancy, becauſe therein we doubted we might be miſunderſtood by the Kingdomes beſt friends.</p>
               <p>But upon His Majeſties continuing importunity for it (as a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nearly concerning His preſent inward and outward contentment: and conceiving thoſe perſons ſuch (as we hoped) would not do ill offices to prejudice the Peace of the Kingdome, we did give way to it, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (before they came) had notice of the permiſſion: And as we then thought, ſo we ſtill do thinke, that to allow him ſome ſuch company of perſons leaſt dangerous, whom former acquaintance may make him take pleaſure in, and the allowance of ſome ſuch Chaplains of His own are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:116153:40"/>things reaſonable and juſt; and the debarring of that liberty in the latter (We doubt) will but make him more prejudiced againſt other Miniſters.</p>
               <p>In general; We humbly conceive that to avoid all harſhneſſe, and afford all kind uſage to his Majeſties Perſon, in things conſiſting with the Peace and Safety of the Kingdome, is the moſt Chriſtian, Honorable and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent way: And in all things (as the Repreſentation and Remonſtrance of the Army doth expreſſe) We think that tender, equitable and moderate dealing, both towards His Majeſty, His Royall Family, and His late par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (ſo farre as may ſtand with ſafety to the Kingdome, and ſecurity to our common Righrs and Liberties) is the moſt hopefull courſe to take away the ſeeds of War or future Feuds amongſt us for poſterity, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a laſting Peace and Agreement in this now diſtracted Nation, To the effecting and ſetling whereof (with a ſecure proviſion firſt to be made for the common Rights and Liberties of the Kingdome, and a due care to preſerve and propagate the Goſpell of Truth and Peace amongſt us) we ſhall hope that neither the Parliament nor his Majeſty will be wanting: And if God ſhall ſee it good to make us any way inſtrumentall thereunto, or that we may otherwiſe ſee the ſame accompliſht, we ſhall then thinke our ſelves indeed diſcharged from the publick engagements we have been called out unto, more clearly and effectually then (before ſuch things were ſetled) we could have thought our ſelves to be, and (to demonſtrate our clearneſſe from ſeeking ſelf-advantages in what we did) we ſhall thenceforth account it our greateſt happineſſe and Honor (if God ſee it good) to be diſingaged and diſiniſt, not only from our military charges, but from all other matters of Power or publick imployment whatſoever.</p>
               <p>I have in theſe things ſpoke, not in my owne Name alone, but in the Name (becauſe I find it to be the clear ſence of generality, or at leaſt of the moſt conſiderable part of the Army, and I am confident you and the Kingdome will never find it otherwiſe, I ſhall leave it to your favorable conſtruction, and commit all to the goodneſſe of God for an happy iſſue, I remain.</p>

               <p>BY the laſt Paper delivered in unto us from your Lordſhips at <hi>Reading July</hi> 7. we perceive you find, that the Expectation of the Parliament and Kingdome is great upon the ſpeedy progreſſe and happy iſſue of this Treaty. We anſwer, that we do really apprehend the ſame things with you, neither can we but witneſſe that you have conſtantly attended the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times of meeting, and preſt diſpatch therein: Nevertheleſſe we cannot but be very ſenſible that you ſeem to reflect upon us further then there is juſt cauſe, in your taking notice that the proceedings herein ſhould be ſlow and dilatory on our part, as if we ſhould not ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and labour the quick and ſpeedy ſettlement o the affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in a ſafe and well-grounded Peace as cordially as any perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. We ſhall therefore deſire you to remember with what forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we have in the firſt place preſented to you thoſe things which we did in our hearts conceive neceſſary in order to a Treaty, and without which being granted, we could not with ſafety to the Kingdome and ſatisfaction to our ſelves proceed in Treaty; and further preſt you to preſent them to the Parliament with ſpeed, that a quick diſpatch might be had therein,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116153:42"/>as being in our thoughts the chiefeſt and ſureſt way to prevent the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this Kingdome in a ſecond War; when contrary to our expectation we have found little effectually done, in relation to our Deſires, in thoſe things moſt concerning the ſafety and peace of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>To the end therefore wee may acquit our ſelves from being guilty of the delay you mention, and that it may appeare to all men where the ſtick is, of not proceeding in the Treaty to a ſettlement of the Peace of the Kingdome, ſo much thirſted after by us all, we thought fit to reminde you of theſe following propoſals which we have formerly inſiſted upon, and to which ſatisfaction is not given.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That there is nothing done with effect, notwithſtanding the Votes of the Houſe, to the diſperſing of the Reformado Officers, who continue in and about</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>ready to head Forces, to the apparent hazzard of a new Warre.</hi>

That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> at the beginning of the late Wars, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving courage ſufficient to performe his duty in <hi>Militia</hi> affairs, did out of covetouſneſſe, or other unworthy end, procure a command of a Troope of horſe, under his Excellency, the late Lord Generall, the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> but when ever his ſaid Troope came upon any ſervice, he the ſaid Maſter <hi>Long</hi> out of feare or treachery, unworthily abſented himſelfe, and never was ſeene or known to charge the Enemy in perſon, though his Troope often engaged, namely at the Battail of <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> when he ſaw there were like to be blows, he the ſaid Mr. <hi>Long</hi> left the field, and never charged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Troop; and at the Battail, or fight at <hi>Brainford,</hi> though his troop were there, yet he ſtaid at <hi>London</hi> till the danger was paſt, and fighting done. And when his Troop was ſent into the Weſt, he took no other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it but to receive his pay, and in the meane while he repaired into the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and procured a commiſſion to be a Colonel of Horſe and in ſtead of fighting againſt the Parliaments enemies, he betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to plunder and oppreſſe the Parliaments friends there, and contrary to Order, and without any authority, or exigencies of Warre compelling him thereunto, enforced great ſums of money, and many Horſes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proviſions from the country, namely from Mr. <hi>Thomas Manwood,</hi> a man well affected, who had the Generalls protections, and (whoſe horſes were taken from his plow) and others, to the great loſſes and oppreſſion of the people, and to the great diſhonour of the Parliament, whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he nevertheleſſe neglected, and hath not hither to given an accompt of the great ſums of money, and other things, that he ſo exacted of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as afore-ſaid.</p>

That the ſaid Maſter <hi>Long</hi> afterwards upon pretence of ſome loſſes ſuſtained by the enemy, and ſome great ſervice he had done for the State, did procure of the Houſe a great office in the Chancery; namely to be the chiefe Regiſter of that Court, wherein his skill was little, and whereof he was, and ſtill is altogether uncapable; and although for a time upon the ſelfe-denying Ordinance he was diſplaced; yet, upon the motion, or by the power and meanes of the ſaid Maſter <hi>Hollis,</hi> he hath obtained the ſame office againe to the great prejudice of skilfull Clerkes that have beene bred up in the ſaid Court, to the diſſervice of the common-wealth and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the Houſe.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116153:51"/>ſuch wayes as he pleaſed, and to that end and purpoſe doth conſtantly place himſelfe neare the doore of the Houſe, that when any debate is concerning any deſigne wherein his party is engaged, he the ſaid Maſter <hi>Long</hi> hath uſed much tampering and violence to ſuch of his owne party as would goe out of the Houſe, and hath perſwaded them to continue there for their Votes, and he the ſaid Mr. <hi>Long</hi> in caſe any ſuch have gone out of the Houſe, hath been very inquiſitive where they might be found, that ſo he may goe for them when the buſineſſe in debate comes neer to be put to the Vote; and if they come not according to his expectation, doth ordinarily and ſpeedily run out of the Houſe himſelfe to call them &amp; drive them in again, that he hath been commonly called (by thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Houſe, and have taken notice of his actions) the Parliament Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; whereby the freedome of the Members is taken from them, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Parliaments proceedings much ſcandalized, and many times evill and dangerous deſignes drove on in a faction by Votes, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>All which matters and things the ſaid Army ſhall and will be ready (in convenient time) to make good by proofe upon Oath, as this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe ſhall direct.

All which being of ſo great concernment to the Kingdome, and not well admitting delay, thought fit to repreſent unto you with ſpeed their ſeverall Papers and Deſires, that I might receive your pleaſure concerning the things they deſire, &amp; your commands for their preſent diſpoſall; to the end they may be better kept in Diſcipline and obedience, and ſuch diſorders prevented, as by reaſon of their want of Officers they may be ſubject to run unto; and likewiſe to continue them in the North, leſt by their motion to the Army they myght draw a greater concourſe and burthen of Souldiers Quarters upon theſe parts then they will be well able to beare, and thereby the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected in thoſe parts (during their abſence) may take that advantage to make inſurrections, or any diſturbance of the peace there. For the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, and diſpoſition of the whole, as well in order to the peace of this Kingdome, as ſpeedy reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhall humbly make bold to offer my opinion, that ſince there are many ſeverall diſtinct, and (through theſe late diſtractions) disjoynted Forces within this Kingdome, which were ſufficient, together with this Army (being united and well manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) both to preſerve the peace of this Kingdom, and give preſent reliefe to <hi>Ireland</hi> (without putting this Kingdome to the charge of raiſing new Forces at preſent for that ſervice) That the Parliament would ſpeedily put all the Forces under one and the ſame Command, Diſcipline, and equall eſtabliſhment for future pay &amp; maintenance, which being done, it would give much encouragement to ſome of the Forces that may be ſpared out of all the Forces mentioned from <hi>England,</hi> to go more cheerfully into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and if with this there were ſome preſent courſe taken to provide for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears for ſuch Forces as might be ſpared for <hi>Ireland,</hi> there might in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility be an effectuall reliefe ſent over into <hi>Ireland</hi> before this Summer be quite ſpent. All which I humbly tender to your conſideration, and deſire your ſpeedy Anſwer, that no time may be loſt in ſo good and neceſſary a work, both for the quiet of this Kingdom, and relief of <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein none ſhall be more ready to expreſſe their forwardneſſe, then</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen this Army was formerly led by the manifold diſpenſations of Gods providence, and the grounds then declared, to advance towards the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> wee held it our duty, to yeeld the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the ſum of thoſe deſires which we had to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on behalf of it, and our ſelves, wherein we ſhould acquieſce: And having received from the Parliament, ſome hopes of due ſatisfaction therein, and ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of the City of <hi>London,</hi> of the ready concurrence with us in thoſe things; and alſo great reſolution profeſſed by them of their care and tenderneſſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:116153:64"/>all the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, ſafe, free, and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from attempts of all kinds, wee doe appeale to God, to the City, and to all men, what a ſpeedy compliance to their deſires for our removall to a further diſtance, found in this Army, for preventing all feares, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and other inconveniences to the Citie, and to give cleare teſtimony, that wee had nothing in our breaſts, but thoughts of peace, and the good and welfare both of Parliament, City, and Kingdome, notwithſtanding many falſe and ſcandalous reports raiſed, that we ſought our ſelves, that we had vile and wicked ends, and that nothing would ſatisfie the Souldier but the plunder of the City; the contrary whereof did manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, when they readily marched back upon hopes of ſatisfaction in their deſires of publique concernment.</p>
            <p>Having then upon the aforeſaid confidence ſo withdrawne, and out of a juſt ſenſe of the Countries ſuffering (by quartering) removed the Head-quarter of the Army above forty miles from <hi>London,</hi> and diſperſed the reſt well nigh two hundred miles, for the more eaſe of all parts, and that wee might give the better ſatisfaction to the Kingdome. And being in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure way, and labouring after the ſuddain ſettlement of the Kingdome, we had even brought to perfection the particular Propoſals (included in the generals of our firſt Repreſentation) to be ſent to the Parliament, for a finall concluſion of all our troubles. And alſo had made good progreſſe towards the preſent reliefe of diſtreſſed <hi>Ireland,</hi> by aſſigning a competent force, both of horſe and foot, forthwith to have advanced for that ſervice.</p>
            <p>But the Kingdomes, and our Enemies being moſt vigilant and active, to prevent and fruſtrate thoſe good intentions, and endeavours of ours; (that they might carry on their former evill deſignes) and under-hand practiſes, and alſo preſerve themſelves from the hand of juſtice, they have endeavoured to caſt the Kingdome into a new and bloudy warre: And for that end have procured the under-hand-liſting of ſeverall Reformadoes, and others, have contrived, promoted, and cauſed to be entred into by ſeverall perſons, a wicked and treaſonable combination, as is ſufficiently manifeſted by a Declaration paſſed thereupon by both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the 23. of <hi>July</hi> laſt, for the prevention of the diſturbances that were like to enſue thereupon; from which kinde of diſorders the Citie had been well preſerved, during the ſpace of almoſt foure yeares, whileſt the <hi>Militia</hi> was in the hands of the old Commiſſioners, whereby it appeares there was cauſe for the Army to intreat the Parliament, that the <hi>Militia</hi> might be returned into the hands it was in before; as alſo for divers other good Reaſons.</p>
            <pb n="122" facs="tcp:116153:65"/>
            <p n="1">1. The old Commiſſioners of the <hi>Militia</hi> (that have been ſince left out) were not onely perſons with out all exception, having been formerly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and approved by the Parliament and Citie; but alſo men of whom the City, Parliament, and Kingdome, have had above foure yeares experience in the faithfull diſcharge of their truſt, men that ever from the beginning, in the worſt of times, and in the occaſions of greateſt difficultie, had faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſtantly ingaged for, and with the Parliament in this cauſe; M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n that were alwayes moſt deſirous of a Peace, but of a ſafe and well grounded one, and that had alwaies teſtified a great care to prevent all occaſions of embroyling the Kingdome in a new Warre.</p>
            <p>Now that on a ſuddain this truſt which they had ſo faithfully diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo long, ſhould be taken out of their hands, and put into the hands of others, ſome whereof (at the beſt) have been very coole in the ſervice of the Parliament at the beginning of this Warre; That this ſhould be preſſed, and in a manner forced upon the Parliament with ſuch importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie from the Common-Councell, that ſome out of every Ward ſhould be aſſigned to ſollicite the Members of the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> every day as they went in and out at the Houſe; with profeſſions that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave the doore of the Houſe, till they were ſatisfied in their deſires. That they would not be contented with the <hi>Militia</hi> of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> onely, unleſſe they might have power alſo over that of the Suburbs and and out parts: and all this before the peace of the Kingdome was ſetled, or the Propoſitions ſent to the King for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe things miniſtred great cauſe of ſuſpition, that this alteration of the <hi>Militia</hi> was in order to a deſigne, and to make the tearmes of the Peace, and agreement with the <hi>King,</hi> (on which the ſecurity of the whole Kingdome, and their poſterity is to be bottomed) more ſutable to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate bargainings and undertakings of ſome men, then to the publique wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the whole Kingdome, in its ſecurity and proſperity, for the preſent, and in future times. But this deſigne diſcovered it ſelfe more cleerely by ſuch things as accompanied the purſuit of this alteration of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and enſued upon the obtaining thereof: At the ſame time that the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> was ſet on foot, the ſame perſons with as much earneſtneſs preſſed for the disbanding of this Army, before any thing was ſetled for the ſecurity and liberty of the Kingdome. At the ſame time the Common-Councell was new modulized, and a Lord Mayor choſen that might ſuite with the preſent deſigne in hand: At the ſaid time (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of differences in ſome circumſtances of Church-Government) it was earneſtly endeavoured, that ſuch as had been conſtantly true and moſt faithfull to the intereſt of the Kingdome ſhould be diſabled, to have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116153:65"/>any imployment in Church or Common-wealth, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and without any ſuch colour or pretence, divers perſons were left out of the Common-Councell, and <hi>Militia,</hi> of eminent deſerts and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and others brought into their roomes that had either teſtified an ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or little affection to the Parliament, and their cauſe: and ſuch as ſeeking to withdraw themſelves from all imployment in the beginning of this Warre, now at the winding up thereof, are ambitious to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into imployment, with a deſigne (as may juſtly be ſuſpected) to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and overthrow in the cloſe of all, the fruit and effect of all the coſt and bloud that hath been ſpent and ſpilt in this cauſe: and after that with difficulty, and not without reluctancy, in the Houſes of Parliament they had obtained the power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and alſo in the out parts for the ſpace of one yeare. Many Officers and under. Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Trained Bands, of known truſt and fidelity were diſplaced, and others of more doubtfull affections placed in their roomes, little care was taken of the honour of the Parliament, which was continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly trampled under-foot, and their authority affronted by every rabble of Women, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, Reformadoes, and Souldiers, which latter ſort of perſons were thereby ſo incouraged to riſe higher and higher, in their tumultuous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages againſt the Houſe, till at length it is riſen to that height of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and monſtrous violence againſt the Parliament, that they might ſet themſelves on worke, and the Kingdome on fire againe. And now at length the deſigne appeares open faced, and though the <hi>Militia</hi> be made as the principall ground of the quarrell, yet by the late vowes and engagements ſet on foote before any alteration of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and the preſſing ſo much the Meſſage of the 12. of <hi>May,</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> comming to <hi>London</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame, ſhew, that the <hi>Militia</hi> is deſired but in order to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and to force the Parliament (being wholly in their power) to ſuch Termes of peace as they pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the next place when the intereſt of the Common Councell, in their change of the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhall be claimed as the Birth-right of the City of <hi>London,</hi> (which they never had any colour to pretend to, ſaving by the indulgency of the Parliament unto them ſince this Parliament, in reſpect of the great uſe they have had of them, and the many good ſervices they have received from them.) It is time for all the Kingdome to look to their Birth-rights, if ſuch a claime ſhall be held up againſt both the Houſes of Parliament, <hi>That upon no occaſion whatſoever, nor in no time of danger and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction whatſoever, they may appoint thoſe that ſhall have the power of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of London, without the conſent of the Councell; eſpecially when as the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall ſit under their power.</hi>

            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:116153:66"/>
            <p>The late Example may evidence to all the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſhall be Maſters of the Parliaments freedome and Reſolutions: And common reaſon will teach every man who ſhall be Maſters of the Birth-rights of the whole Kingdome, when there ſhall be no Army on foots, when they have the confidence to diſpute for the Maſtery, notwithſtanding ſuch an Army as this to checke and ballance them in behalfe of the Kingdome and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, The Army diſcerning how intimate ſome of the new <hi>Militia</hi> were with ſome of the 11. accuſed Members, how forward they were to comply and act with them in their endeavours, to raiſe a new Warre; how they made 18. or 19. Votes in order thereunto together with them in one night.</p>
            <p>All which, the Common-Councell and Parliament diſliked and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, how notwithſtanding afterwards they ſecretly promoted their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes by private Liſtings, which now appeare to have been ſtill working under ground.</p>
            <p>The Army, wee ſay, obſerving this, and having nothing more in their thoughts and deſires, then to ſettle a ſpeedy, ſafe, and well-grounded peace, and to prevent a new Warre, found it neceſſary to deſire,</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Militia</hi> might be put into the hands wherein it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who had approoved themſelves both to the Army, Parliament, and Kingdome, to be ſober-minded men, and not given to any practiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a new Warre might be kindled.</p>
            <p>To the intent, that the Army being ſecured by that meanes from that danger, might with the more confidence retire further from the City, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Quarter for the greater eaſe of the Kingdome, and intend wholly the ſetling of a ſure peace in this Kingdome, and a ſpeedy and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was almoſt brought to a period, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſight of man could have hindred, <hi>but this curſed practice of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon the Parliament, under pretence of the</hi> Militia, <hi>which according to our deſire, being reſtored againe into the hands of the old Commiſſioners, by an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of both Houſes, dated the</hi> 21. <hi>of</hi> July, <hi>(in purſuance of the aforeſaid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable combination) ſeverall Petitions were preſented to the Common-Councell of the City of LONDON, in the name of the Apprentices and others, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their Deſires, that the</hi> Militia <hi>of the City might continue in the hands of the former Commiſſioners, according to the Ordinance of the</hi> 4. <hi>of May laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon Monday <hi>July</hi> the ſix and twentieth, the Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the City preſents their Petitions to both Houſes, for changeing the <hi>Militia,</hi> wherein the Houſe of Lords refuſe to alter their reſolutions; the Houſe of Commons anſwered, they would take it into conſideration
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116153:66"/>the next morning. Notwithſtanding which, the City and Kingdome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant with what rage and inſolency the tumult of Apprentices the ſame day forced both Houſes. They blockt up their doores, ſwearing they would keepe them in, till they had paſſed what Votes they pleaſed; they threatened the Houſes, if they granted not their deſires, knocking, hooping, and hallowing ſo at the Parliament-doores, that many times the Members could not be heard to ſpeake or debate, not ſuffering the Houſe of Commons to divide for determining ſuch Queſtions, as were put, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>That thoſe that gave their Votes againſt them, ſhould be ſent out to them;</hi> very often and loudly, ſaying, <hi>Agree, agree, diſpatch, wee'l wait no longer;</hi> and in this outragious manner, they continued at the Houſe doore above eight houres together, the City-Guards there preſent, nor the City relieving them, by reaſon whereof the Houſe was forced to Vote what that rude multitude would demand, and then adjourned the Houſe till the next morning; After which the Houſe riſing, the Speaker and many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers going out of the Houſe, they forc'd them back againe into the Houſe: Many of the Apprentices preſſing in with them, where they ſtood with their hats on their heads, and compelled the Speaker to take the Chaire, and the Houſe to Vote in their preſence what they pleaſed, committing many other inſolencies, as is publiſhed by the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons in his Declararation, and is too well known by all then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; And during the time of this execrable violence done by the ſaid Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall and the Pallace-yard was ſild with Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does and other ill-affected perſons deſigned to back them.</p>
            <p>After this the Houſes being adjourned till Friday following, upon the Thurſday the Apprentices printed and poſted a paper in ſeverall places of the Citie, requiring all their fellowes to be early at the Parliament the next morning, for that they intended to adjourne by ſeven of the clock, and that for a moneth. Thus the Speakers with many of the Members of both Houſes were driven away from the Parliament.</p>
            <p>This in briefe being the true ſtate of things, as they have broke forth within theſe few dayes, (which are ſo contrary to all thoſe pretences of Peace, and deteſtation of a new Warre, of late ſo frequently held forth on all ſides,) all men may obſerve to what maturity the long projected De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of ſome men, (of whom are thoſe that are impeached by us,) is now brought, and may be traced in the ſeverall ſteps thereof, as it hath tended to the enſlaving this Kingdome, and the deſtruction of all ſuch well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted people, who would not comply with them therein; ſo as by what now is come to light, the juſtneſſe of that cauſe, this Army had engaged themſelves in, and the great and wonderfull mercy of God in continuing

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116153:70"/>of the Kingdome were ſettled (which upon their firſt motion of withdrawing wee had inſiſted on,) did not gaineſay. And thereupon we proceeded in a quiet and hopefull way to prepar more particular propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls (in perſuance of our former generall deſires) for the preſent ſetling of the peace of the Kingdome to be tendred to the Commiſſioners of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament reſiding with the Army for that purpoſe. But finding that while wee were thus peaceably proceeding, the ſaid impeached members (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their pretended deſires to travell) did continue in and about <hi>London</hi> very active and buſie to raiſe warre, or make diſturbances in the Kingdome, and that the Committee of the <hi>Militia</hi> there did comply with them therein (by daily liſting of men and other preparations towards warre, and ſheltring to that end, yea, and entertaining into ſervice thoſe ſame Reformadoes, who (by Ordinance of Parliament,) were by them to have been put out of the Lines of Communication) and finding continuall jealouſies and diſturbances to our ſaid proceedings, bred in the Army by the daily reports and alarms thereof from the Citie, wee made a particular addreſſe to the Parliament for the reſtoring of the Citie <hi>Militia</hi> into thoſe hands, in which it was before the Ordinance of the fourth of <hi>May</hi> laſt.

               <p>By this meanes the Speakers of both Houſes, together with moſt of the Lords, and a very great number of the moſt faithfull and unqueſtioned Members of the Houſe of Commons were driven away, ſo as they could not with ſafety attend their ſervice in Parliament, nor with freedome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their truſt to the Kingdome therein, but were forced to fly to their Army for ſafety, ſo as there was not, nor could then be, and free meeting or legall proceeding of a Parliament.

Taking this opportunitie of time, to carry on their deſignes, when very few were left, but of their owne party, did continue to meet in the uſuall places in <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> And (having under pretence of a neceſſity for continuing the Parliament, by adjournement, they drawn in ſome few well-minded Members to ſit with them, out of a ſcruple leaſt the Parliament ſhould fall for want of adjournement,) took upon them the name of both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And having on Friday <hi>July</hi> 30. choſen a new Speaker, did proceed to Vote and Act as a Parliament, and adjourned from time to time; But of what party and confederacy the moſt of them were, and to what ends and intereſts they acted, will appeare by what they did whereof we ſhall for preſent give a taſte in ſome particulars, hoping that ſhortly the whole Journall of their proceedings may be made publick.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſaid Members of the Houſe of Commons (conveening as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) immediately Voted and called in (as to the ſervice of the Houſe, the Eleven impeached Members. And alſo thoſe who upon former Votes of the Houſe were ſuſpended, or under Queſtion to be put out for Delinquency, and had put in their caſes; with this pretended Houſe of Commons thus compoſed, and foure or five Lords of the ſame. Modell (for an houſe of Peares) they proceed to ſet up a Committee for ſafety,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:116153:72"/>(whereof almoſt all of the ſaid impeached Members were apart) this Committee they appointed to joine with that ſame pretended Committee of the City <hi>Militia,</hi> whoſe power was obtained only by the tumultuous force and violence aforeſaid: To theſe Committees the moſt or many of their proceedings referre, and by divers pretended Votes, Orders, and Ordinances, procured in the name of one or both Houſes of Parliament, large powers were given to theſe two Committees for raiſing of Forces, appointing chiefe Commanders and other Officers, and other vaſt, unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and unuſuall powers were given them, all tending to the raiſing and levying of a new Warre within this Kingdome: upon which many forces both of Horſe and Foot, were actually levyed, and other prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Warre made; all which, that they were intended and deſigned in Juſtification, proſecution, and maintenance of the aforeſaid treaſonable engagement, and of the ſaid force and violence done to the parliament, or of the very ſame ends and intereſts, and to oppoſe and hinder the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Houſes of Parliament, to their honour and freedome and the advance of this their Army for that purpoſe (being then upon a March.

To have the King brought up to</hi> London <hi>without delay, or any nearer upproach of the Army.</hi> And to all theſe, the ſucceeding Votes of the pretended Houſes, for the ſame thing did ſpeedily eccho the ſame note: Concerning which matter (not to examine the alteration of the caſe, ſince both Houſes, and both Kingdomes alſo (of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>) reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it was not ſafe the King ſhould come to <hi>London,</hi> untill he had given ſatisfaction and ſecutity to his people in relation to thoſe publick ends, for which ſo much bloud and treaſure had been ſpent) we ſhall only ſay thus much to thoſe mens intentions and deſignes in the buſineſſe: That had the King come up to <hi>London</hi> (as they have ſo oft deſired and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:116153:72"/>it is apparent they intended and would have made uſe of it, rather to lay the ſtronger foundations of a new Warre (upon the ruines of that publick intereſt contended for in the former, and of all thoſe that had with moſt candor, cleareneſſe, and ſimplicity of heart, appeared and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſame, then any way to ſettle thereby a ſafe and well-grounded peace. And ſince they could not rationally expect ſo eaſie an obtaining of the Kings perſon to <hi>London,</hi> upon ſuch a pretended Vote or Declaration of their deſire thereof, it is as evident that they could intend nothing thereby, but a more plauſible pretence, and foundation of quarrell againſt this Army, whereby to ingage or incline to their aſſiſtance the Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſuch others, who might be catcht with the apprehenſion thereof, as a ſpeedy way to Peace (the thing ſo generally longed for) and by ſuch aſſiſtance gained the better to ruine this Army, and thoſe faithfull Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, who were retired to it. For our parts we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice as much as any, to ſee the King brought back to his Parliament (and that) not ſo much in place, as in affection and agreement on ſuch ſound termes and grounds, as may render both Him and the Kingdome, ſafe, quiet and happy, and ſhall be as ready as any to bring his Majeſty to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> when his being there may be likely to produce (not greater diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, but) a Peace indeed. And that ſuch as may not (with the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of publick intereſt) be ſhaped and moulded only to the private advantages of a particular party or faction. But bottomed cheifly on grounds of common and publick welfare and ſecurity. And if (without regard to theſe conſiderations) we would have brought his Majeſty with us to <hi>London,</hi> in our late advance thither (which our enimies could not hinder or prejudice us in) we had no cauſe to doubt, but (as to men) we might have had all the advantages which our adverſaries promiſed to themſelves, thereby added to the ſtrength and intereſt of the Army, and have inverted the diſadvantages upon them that they intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us thereby; ſo as his Majeſties ſo much deſired to come to <hi>London,</hi> might have been much to their prejudice, and our advantage and ſecurity, if we had regarded only our owne particulars.</p>
               <p>But (as at preſent our conſciences beare cleare witneſſes to our ſelves,) ſo we hope God will in the iſſue make it cleare to others, that we have not minded, nor been acting our owne workes or intereſts, but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and every honeſt mans in it. Mean while (to return to our purpoſe) we thinke it is ſufficiently cleared, that the proceedings of thoſe members, or the major part of them (that continued to ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> during the abſence of the Speakers) the powers by them given, the forces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon levied, and other preparations of Warre thereupon made, were all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116153:73"/>deſigned and driven on in proſecution and maintenance of the ſaid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ingagement, and of the force done upon the Parliament, or for the ſame ends and intereſt with them, and to oppoſe the advance of this Army towards <hi>London,</hi> for reſtitution of the Parliament to honour and freedome, and indeed to raiſe a new warre in the Kingdome againſt the Parliament and their Army for the deſtruction thereof. And the ſame may (yet further) appear by this that thoſe very Appentices, Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and others about the City, who were the cheife actors in the ſaid ingagement and tumult, were afterwards moſt truſted and imployed, and moſt active in their preparations for War.</p>
               <p>By what we have here ſaid and what hath been declared and publiſhed from us, and from the Speakers, and aforeſaid Members of both Houſes, and by the whole ſeries of our owne, and our enemies actions and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, (compared together) it may appeare how tender we have been not only of the authority and juſt Priviledges of Parliament, and of the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, peace, and welfare both of the Kingdome and the City, but even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe our enemies themſelves (ſeeking only things neceſſary for the common good of the whole, (and that if poſſible) without ruine or hurt to any, and yet how maliciouſly and unworthily we have that while been dealt withall by thoſe our enemies, and by a factious and powerfull par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (eſpecially) in Parliament and City combining with them: And what cleare cauſe we have had both for all that we have formerly deſired or done in prevention of our owne ruine and the Kingdomes diſturbance, and alſo what juſt grounds for our late advance to <hi>London.</hi> The good ſervice whereof (eſpecially in reſtoring the Parliament into a condition of ſafety, honour and freedome, thereby hath been, (without any ſeeking of ours) acknowledged by both Houſes with thankes to us, and publick thankeſgiving to the Almighty for it; And a further truſt hath been thereupon committed to the Generall for taking care with his Army to ſafe-guard the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Houſes being thus reſtored to a condition of preſent ſafety, honor and freedome; Two things ſeem clearly remaining to be done, (which our owne and moſt mens expectations are moſt ſet upon) <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, to vindicate the honour, freedome, and ſafety of Parliament from the like affronts or violences in future, and the Army and Kingdome from danger of the like diſturbances (whilſt things ſhall be in a debate or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for a ſettlement) and then to proceed unto a ſpeedy ſettlement of the peace of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The latter of theſe is firſt in our intentions (being neareſt to the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end. And we ſhal earneſtly deſire in order therunto, the propoſals of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:116153:73"/>the Army (whereof the heads are publiſhed) may be ſpeedily conſidered and brought to a reſolution. But conſidering that the debates of them may take up ſome time ere they be agreed on all hands, and the framing of them into Bils, and perfecting of the ſame will require much more. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt firſt be done in the former for a preſent ſecurity to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from like affronts or violence, and to the Army and Kingdome from the like diſturbances to the peace thereof by any farther advantage, which the time like to be ſpent in the ſetling of peace, may afford to our watchfull, reſtleſſe, and (we doubt) implacable enemies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore to thoſe ends (unleſſe it ſhould be thought fit to ſecure the Parliament by keeping the whole body of the Army, or ſo great a part thereof, to remain continually in and about <hi>London,</hi> as might be ſure to over-power any future tumults or force that may ariſe out of the City and eaſe of the parts adjacent, nor the ſafety of the Kingdome in reſpect of the preſent poſture of affaires will admit).</p>
               <p>It is abſolutely neceſſary that there be ſpeedy and exemplary juſtice done upon (at leaſt) the cheif authors or abettors of the ſaid treaſonable engagement, and of the ſaid force done to the Parliament, and upon the chief actors, in maintenance and proſecution thereof (whereby men may be deterred from the like in future.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo as neceſſary to the ſecurity of the Army, and peace of the Kingdome, ſince it is apparent by all that hath been ſaid, and by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other evidences (too many to recount.) That both the ſaid ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the force done to the Parliament, and the power of the City <hi>militia</hi> thereby gained, and the ſucceeding votes and orders of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Houſes (but indeed of that faction that are our profeſſed enemies) in maintenance and proſecution thereof, and the Forces thereupon levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (put under the command of Major Gen. <hi>Maſſey</hi> and others our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed adverſaries) were all deſigned and directed to the ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Army, and the raiſing of a new war againſt us in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; And having had ſuch experience of their reſtleſſe malice and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell intentions towards us (notwithſtanding our tenderneſſe and lenity towards them) and of their treacherous dealing (ſo ſoon as they thought they had the advantage) notwithſtanding all their ſemblances of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to a compoſure; what reaſon is there to expect, but that if by our patience and delays they apprehend in future the like or other advantage, they will break out againe into the like or worſe attempts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and war, if all eſcape with impunity for theſe.</p>
               <p>But, as to this point of ſecurity by exemplary juſtice in an ordinary, way, we ſee our hopes almoſt fruſtrated, whilſt (though our deſires and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116153:74"/>reſolutions to that purpoſe expreſt in our late Declaration of the grounds of our advance towards <hi>London,</hi> were then ſeconded with the declared approbation and concurrent reſolutions of the Speakers and Members of both Houſes that were driven away to the Army, and with their ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to live and die with us therein.

               <p>His Majeſty having peruſed the Propoſitions now brought to Him, finds them the ſame in effect which were offered to him at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> To ſome of which as Hee could not then conſent without violation of His conſcience, and honour; ſo neither can he agree to others now, conceiving them in many reſpects more diſagreeable to the preſent condition of affaires, then when they were formerly preſented to Him, as being deſtructive to the main and principall intereſts of the Army, and of all thoſe whoſe affections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with them. And His Majeſty having ſeen the Propoſals of the Army to the Commiſſioners from His two houſes, reſiding with them, &amp; with them to be treated on in order to the clearing and ſecuring the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdom, and the ſetling a juſt and laſting peace. To which Propoſalls as he conceives His two Houſes not to be ſtrangers, ſo he believes they will think with him that they much more conduce to the ſatisfaction of all intereſts, and may be a fitter foundation for a laſting peace then the Propoſitions which at this time are tendred unto Him.</p>
               <p>Hee therefore propounds (as the beſt way in his judgment in order to peace) that His two Houſes would inſtantly take into conſideration thoſe Propoſalls, upon which there may be a perſonall Treaty with His Majeſty, and upon ſuch other Propoſitions as His Majeſty ſhall make, hoping that the ſaid Propoſalls may be ſo moderated in the ſaid Treaty, as to render them the more capable of his Majeſties full conceſſions, wherein He reſolves
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:116153:82"/>to give full ſatisfaction unto his people for whatſoever ſhal concern the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Proteſtant profeſſion, with liberty to tender conſciences, &amp; the ſecuring of the Laws, Liberties, and properties of all His Subjects, and the juſt priviledges of Parliament for the future. And likewiſe by His preſent deportment in this Treaty, He will make the world clearly judg of His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in matter of future government: In which Treaty His Majeſty wil be well pleaſed (if it bee thought fit) that Commiſſioners from the Army (whoſe Propoſals are) may likewiſe be admitted.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie therefore conjures his two houſes of Parliament by the duty they owe to God, and His Majeſty their King, and by the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion they have to their fellow-Subjects, both for reliefe of their preſent ſufferings, and to prevent future miſeries, that they will forthwith accept of His Majeſties offer, whereby the joyfull news of peace may be reſtored to this diſtreſſed Kingdome.</p>
               <p>And for what concerns the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> mentioned in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, His Majeſty will very willingly treat upon thoſe particulars with the Scotch Commiſſioners, and doubts not but to give reaſonable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to that His Kingdome.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>IAmes Simball</hi> Deputy Keeper of Wincheſter houſe, lying ſicke, hearing a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallier, there a priſoner, then ſay, That the Parliament were Rebells and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and that if the King came to <hi>London</hi> with his Army, hee would make the Parliament a poore Parliament, and Exemplary for their Rebellion, by chopping off their heads at the doore: The ſaid Cavallier neer two years after, boaſting of a deſigne intended againſt the Parliament, and being queſtioned for the ſame by the ſaid <hi>Simball,</hi> out of malice did accuſe him for ſpeaking againſt the King in theſe words, viz. <hi>That he</hi> (<hi>the ſaid</hi> Simball) <hi>hoped to ſee the Kings head upon the Tower blocke:</hi> When indeed the ſaid words were ſpoken in Anſwer to thoſe above mentioned, &amp; upon theſe conditions: That if the King had any ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then he the ſaid <hi>Simball</hi> hoped as afore-ſaid; and thus much the ſaid Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier himſelfe did confeſſe, but afterwards denyed. Now the ſaid <hi>Simball</hi> being indicted without any cognizance, taken of theſe circumſtances, ſtands convicted by the only teſtamony of the ſaid Cavallier ever ſince the Aſſizes held in <hi>March</hi> laſt, and adjudged with <hi>Francis Wade,</hi> and <hi>Robert White,</hi> by Serjeant <hi>Creſwell,</hi> to forfeit their whole eſtates, and remaine priſoners during the Kings pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis Wade</hi> being urged to drinke the Kings health, denyed it, ſaying, that King <hi>James</hi> ſaid, That the King which ruled not according to his Lawes, is no longer a King, but a Tyrant: and that the King had put the Parliament out of his protection, and in them the whole Kingdom. Therefore no King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert White</hi> having been a ſouldier in the Parliaments ſervice, was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon his return, what he would have done to the King: had he met him in the head of his Army, anſwered, he would as ſoone have killed him as another man.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>James Simball</hi> being at this inſtant a priſoner, and in Irons at the ſaid Gaole, was indicted by one <hi>Wimball,</hi> formerly a Cavallier, ſonne in law, and partner

               <p>
                  <hi>Francis Wade, Robert White,</hi> and <hi>Roger Crab,</hi> are return'd as priſoners in the Kalender to the <hi>White Lion</hi> by Juſtice <hi>Bacon,</hi> who fined Mr. <hi>Deviniſh,</hi> late Keeper of the ſaid County Gaole, threeſcore pounds for ſuffering the ſaid priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to have ſome liberty.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Crabs</hi> caſe the Jury brought him guilty of the words ſpoken by him, but they were neither ſeditious, ſcandalous, nor pernitious; Juſtice <hi>Bacon</hi> uſed much Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perſwade the Jury to finde the judgement, they having formerly twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He extream wants of the Souldiery (both of the Army and other Forces and Garriſons that have concurred with us, as alſo the ſufferings of the Countries in reſpect of free Quarter, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Kingdome for a ſpeedy ſupply of money in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the disbanding of ſuperfluous forces, the ſending over of others for the reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for the ſupplying of thoſe Forces that are there already, ſo as to prevent the danger of thoſe diſtempers lately raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) are ſuch as we are and have been very ſenſible of, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly preſſed with the conſideration of them.</p>
               <p>Yet the care the Houſes have ſo many wayes expreſt for providing a preſent ſupply of monies, in relation to all theſe affaires, have made us hitherto ſilent as to that point, in expectation to have found ere this time an anſwerable effect thereof in actuall ſupplies. But finding that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their care, yet through the neglect or delay of thoſe on whom the Houſes have depended in that particular, there is little or nothing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto effected therein: and eſpecially conſidering the delayes made by the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-councell of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in the advancing of that ſumme which the Houſes have demanded of them upon the ſecurity of their Arrears (ſo long ſince) due from the City to this Army, and for that tax whereupon all or moſt other places have long ſince paid in their proportions: We are inforced to make this preſent addreſſe to the Houſes in relation thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wee cannot but conſider the notorious readineſſe of that Court to the advancing of far greater ſums for the raiſing of a new War, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the late miſchievous practices and deſigns againſt the Parliament and Army. And that as their precipitate forwardneſſe therein, was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Armies comming into theſe parts: ſo their backwardneſſe to the raiſing or advancing of the money now required for the ſervice of the Parliament and ſupply of the Army, hath been, and is the occaſion of the Armies continuance here; And therefore wee cannot but offer it as what we humbly conceive moſt juſt and reaſonable.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:116153:84"/>
               <p>That for what time their default or delays have occaſioned and ſhall further occaſion the Armies ſtay hereabouts (ſo much as to the burthen &amp; oppreſſion of theſe parts) the charge thereof ſhould ſome way be laid upon them and their adherents in and about the City, together with thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from whom the ſaid Arreares are due, and thoſe in whoſe default it lyes that they have hitherto been either not aſſeſſed, or not collected. And for that purpoſe that at leaſt in caſe the ſumm required for ſo long time as the payment thereof ſhall be further delayed. Next foraſmuch as the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, may perhaps conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not ſo much obliged (either to execute the authority given them by the Parliament for levying of money upon others, or to advance it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by way of loan in behalf of others, until it can belevied) as they would be to provide what ſhould juſtly be charged upon themſelves: Wee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly offer (at leaſt) in caſe the ſum required upon the Arreares be not paid in by the time limited,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Houſes would be pleaſed ſpeedily to conſider of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of that Court and Councell, in thoſe things that were lately done by them as a Court, and ſet ſuch Fine upon them for the ſame as ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to juſtice, which money being chargeable ſo properly upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we preſume they will not have the like excuſe not to provide; Laſtly, ſince it is moſt evident that for the ſpeedy bringing in of the money requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the arrears, there wants not in the ſaid Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, either authority to levy it, or ability to advance it by way of Loan, til it can be levied: nor doe the perſons from whence the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears are due, want ability to pay them, but the only fault and defect lies in the want of will to the thing, both in the one and in the other, and want of power in the hands of willing men to enforce it, without which wee ſee little hopes that it will in any tolerable time be effected; We therefore offer,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in caſe the money be not brought in (by the time limited) the Parliament would be pleaſed to give leave and power to the Generall (with the advice and directions of the Committee for the Army) for the levying of the ſaid arrears, together with ſuch penalties and fine as the Houſes ſhall find cauſe to impoſe as afore-ſaid, or (at leaſt) the penalties allowed by the Ordinances for that tax for the Armie, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>And all theſe things we deſire the rather, becauſe we have grounds both of reaſon and evidence from the ſpeeches of many in the City, to believe that in this long with-holding of money, the deſigns and hopes of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and our enemies, are to raiſe the Army into diſtempers, and the Countrey about into a flame, whereby at leaſt to hinder and interrupt all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:116153:85"/>proceedings to the execution of Parliamentary juſtice, or ſettlement of the Kingdome, and to expoſe the Parliament again into tumultuous violence, of all which the danger is very evident and imminent, if not ſpeedily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by ſome ſuch vigorous and effectuall remedies as afore-ſaid.</p>
